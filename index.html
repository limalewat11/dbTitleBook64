For this exhibition MoMA director Alfred Barr remarked, "Usually the na�ve artist works in the easier medium of painting. Edmondson, however, has chosen to work in limestone, which he attacks with extraordinary courage and directness, to carve out simple, emphatic forms." Robert Bishop, the late director of the Museum of American Folk Art, declared Edmondson to be "one of the outstanding folk carvers--if not the outstanding one--of the twentieth century." </p><p>Edmondson's first works were memorial gravestones. Later he created animal, human, and celestial figures. His carvings were inspired by his faith, community, and culture. He told the story of how God spoke to him. "I was out in the driveway with some old pieces of stone when I heard a voice telling me to pick up my tools and start to work on a tombstone. I looked up in the sky and right there in the noon daylight He hung a tombstone out for me to make." </p><p>Showcasing Edmondson's sculpture and placing it in the mainstream of American art for the first time, this lavishly illustrated volume accompanies a traveling exhibition organized by the Cheekwood Museum of Art in Nashville. In new interpretations that challenge long-held views about Edmondson's artistic naievet�, the essays emphasize his profound and intimate connection to his community and its traditions. Adding immeasurably to the understanding of Edmondson's art are photographs by Edward Weston, Louise Dahl-Wolfe, and Consuelo Kanaga that show the artist in his community and his workplace.</p></p><p>A showcase of works by the Tennessee artist called the greatest folk carver of the twentieth century</p><h2>Running Around (And Such) (Lizzie Searches for Love, Book 1)</h2><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A romance novel by an Amish writer, based on true experiences! It isn't that Lizzie doesn't want to stay Amish. It's just that there is so much to figure out. Like why can't she let her hair a little looser on top? And why can't she wear shoes with a little bit more of a heel? And will she ever really just know for a fact who she is going to marry like her next-older sister, Emma, does? And how does it happen that her just-younger sister, Mandy, is going on a date before Lizzie ever has a real one? So does it matter at all if she eats one more whoopie pie? Amos seems to like her a lot when she pounds out the ping-pong games. He even asks her to be his partner in doubles. But then he asks Ruthie if he can take her home!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been this way Lizzie's whole life. She has too hot a temper. She hates housework and dislikes babies. She loves driving fast horses but is petrified of going away from home for a week to work as a maud (maid). Now that Lizzie is running around, will she scare off the Amish boys with her hi-jinks manners? She has certainly attracted the attention of the egg-truck driver. A scary thrill runs through her every time the worldly man comes to pick up an order, each time extending his stay a little longer. How long will she keep this a secret from Emma&#x2014;and from Mamm and Datt? What will become of Lizzie? Is she too spirited, too innocent, and almost too uninhibited for a young Amish woman?<br><br>Skyhorse Publishing, as well as our Arcade, Yucca, and Good Books imprints, are proud to publish a broad range of books for readers interested in fiction&#x2014;novels, novellas, political and medical thrillers, comedy, satire, historical fiction, romance, erotic and love stories, mystery, classic literature, folklore and mythology, literary classics including Shakespeare, Dumas, Wilde, Cather, and much more.

Parenting is the most important and noble act you will ever undertake, yet American families are threatened like never before from the inside as well as the outside -- many of us fight too much, don't get involved enough in our children's lives, or get bogged down in life's daily struggles instead of keeping our eye on the big picture of our family's well-being. <br> Dr. Phil has been working with families for over twenty-five years to help them repair the fissures that have fractured their home lives. In <i>Family First,</i> he provides a proven action plan to help parents determine the strengths and weaknesses of their parenting style. His 7 Tools for Purposeful Parenting cover the most important elements for any parent: parenting for success -- for the purpose of raising cooperative, caring, and competent children. Exercises, scripts, assessments, solutions for specific problems, and precise directions for implementing the steps you need to take are all included in this landmark work. <br> Dr. Phil shows parents how to make changes now -- how to put a stop to your children's tantrums; talk to them about peer pressure or self-esteem; instill values like integrity, honesty, and respect for other people; and bring order back to your house. If you want your child to have a happy, fulfilled life, you must open your eyes to the crucial role you play in his or her development. <br> Most important, Dr. Phil's new book offers you and your family hope -- for a phenomenal home life now, and a productive, fulfilling future for your children. As Dr. Phil says, you are not just raising children, you are also raising adults, and everything you do today impacts what kind of adult your child will become. You are building the future.</p><p>"Dr. Phil" (Phillip C.

Every day, he troops in and out of those two worlds, in and out of the tiny paint-peeled tract house he lives in with his father, mother and three sisters. To say his is a modest neighborhood is kind. To the casual observer the houses are indistinguishable. There is kind of a peace and order to the cookie-cutter sameness, everything in its place and a place for everything. At least so it appears. Like every other neighborhood in America, suburbia or the inner city, every home is a fa�ade, an outward face that betrays little of what lies inside. Sometimes what is inside is the opposite of peaceful. Behind the social masks, all too often lie families that are chaotic and disconnected, that threaten to disintegrate with the next crisis. The boy lives in just such a house and in just such an American family.<br><br>Outside the doors of his home, the boy finds a world that seems immeasurably more validating. He has a small group of friends and acquaintances to whom he in some ways feels closer than his own family. Yet they too seem distant and different because he is different, at least in his own eyes. Among them, he, like so many others, wears a social mask of "okayness," but he doesn't know theirs is a mask as well. He seems relaxed, even confident, but secretly he's always on guard, because he knows he's not like them, not really. He knows he and his family are poor and that they live differently with different problems, problems you just don't talk about. He's making one of the first and most common mistakes children make: He's comparing his private reality, his world behind the door, to the social mask of all of his friends. He assumes that what he sees is the truth, and in comparison, his image of his own family situation suffers dismally.<br><br>In the world beyond his home, the discovery of athletics has been an absolute godsend. He and his family don't have the money, the clothes or the ability to participate in any of the extracurricular activities except for sports, which are free to all students. In fact, at his young age, the boy already works two jobs, and so he embraces sports as a leveling device. On the playing field, he doesn't have to talk or be like everybody else; he doesn't have to have money or a fancy upbringing or even a stable home. He just has to be what he is -- a strong and coordinated kid, able to excel at just about any sport. Through athletics, he has found not only his self-esteem but an acceptable outlet for a burning anger that he doesn't understand, but knows is always there. Even with sports as an outlet, violence and fights are an everyday occurrence in a rough testosterone-driven world. Backing down is not an option. Because of sports, the urge to win has been planted in his head like a fast-growing seed -- he loves being in the thick of competition and he has learned what it takes to win and others are eager to follow. The seed has sprouted; he doesn't like being second-best.<br><br>School life is less comfortable. He is smart, though not academically motivated. He reads all of his textbooks from cover to cover the first few weeks of school and masters the material, but could care less about class or grades. Homework is turned in only if it is handy to do so. Teachers find him quietly charming but reluctant to get involved. His writing is excellent when he bothers to do it. His test average is A+.<br><br>To his twelve-year-old sensibilities, being out with his buddies, playing sports with a passion and getting through each day are what life is all about -- "out there," at least, in "that world." Out there, in that world, he is his own person, but always with an undertow from the other world, the world behind the door.<br><br>Once he goes home, he enters a completely different world, and he becomes a completely different person.<br><br>Cut off from his friends, his athletics and his school life, he is withdrawn, sullen, depressed, lethargic and emotionally detached from the rest of his family. Being the only boy, he has his own small room and he stays in it the vast majority of his time. He has no television, not even a radio. He just stays quietly to himself and even comes and goes through his bedroom window to avoid walking through the house. Unbeknownst to his parents he roams the streets after the family is asleep. He sleeps little as his paper route starts at 4:30 a.m. Days and nights don't seem much different when you are alone. He yearns for the hours to pass so he can make his way out into the other world, the one in which he is more functional, engaging, successful and motivated, at least in some areas of life. There is an astonishing contrast between what he is like in that world, out there, and what he is like in this world, in here.<br><br>But why?<br><br>Before that question is answered, let me tell you that in the many years that I've worked with the parents of troubled youngsters like this one, it became quite common to hear a mother or father request that their "problem" child be fixed. "Get our child straight!" they would demand. "We just don't know what happened! He just seemed to go downhill overnight. He is so withdrawn, so down and depressed. What is wrong with him? Can't you do something to fix this problem?"<br><br>Is this right thinking? Not even almost. No matter what maladaptive behaviors a child is exhibiting, I can guarantee you that the problem is almost certainly with the entire family, and most often the child is just the sacrificial lamb dragged to the altar of the counselor because he or she happens to be making the most noise and has the least amount of power or ability to shift the focus to someone else.<br><br>Trying to understand a child's behavior without interviewing the rest of the family just won't cut it, and any therapist worth their salt knows it. I want to be sure you know it too. So let's step through the front door with the twelve-year-old boy I described earlier and observe the other five parts that would be missed if a therapist, or more importantly, you, as a defensive parent, trivialized or ignored the family aspect.<br><br>Life "in there," life with his family unit, is tumultuous, volatile and unpredictable. Here's the real cause for this boy's refusal to plug into his family: His father is a severe and chronic alcoholic. He is typically emotionally unavailable to the boy, and to the rest of the family. He and the boy have clashed violently when the alcohol takes over and while the father barely remembers the confrontations, the experiences are seared into the boy's mind and heart. Further, the father has aborted his career in sales, uprooted the family, moved to a new state and returned to school at a university in the hope of a brighter yet highly speculative future. Though nobly inspired, this decision hurtled this family of six into grinding poverty. There is little inner connection as each family member's own personal struggles drain them of energy. Hunger gnaws at times and doing without is just how it is. Life is insecure, as the children are the poor "new" kids. Life is emotionally barren, full of desperation and drama, with one crisis after another. Tired and struggling, this family is not coping well at all.<br><br>dClearly scarred by the psychological and emotional stress, the boy's two older sisters try in their own way to escape the turmoil. But this turns out to be a classic case of "out of the frying pan into the fire." Both sisters have ill-fated elopements with boyfriends before finishing high school. Tension is everywhere in the home. The boy loves his sisters and they have protected him and helped him in a number of ways, but then they were gone. When they returned home, they were strangely different. They weren't just the other kids in the family anymore. And so, the boy feels further isolated. Although loving and caring, the mother works long and grueling hours on her feet as a store clerk just to keep food on the table. She is ill-equipped to deal with or counterbalance such a dominantly patriarchal family and such disconnected kids fleeing from their father's alcoholism. Baby sister is cute but silent. God only knows what she must be thinking. She is extremely dependent, afraid to leave home even to sleep over at a friend's house. She must stay close; this deal could cave any minute. The boy stays close to her, and they talk late at night, but he realizes that the less she knows, the better.<br><br>Both the mother and father were born into poor, uneducated families, and consequently, they had very little idea that life offered anything other than what they were exposed to. Tragically, the father had suffered severe mental, emotional and physical abuse at the hands of his own mother, and this legacy crippled his relationship with his own wife and children.<br><br>This is the world in which we find this twelve-year-old boy. He is embedded in a family on the verge of imploding and to evaluate him in isolation would be an exercise in futility. There is in this world an enveloping bleakness.<br><br>Trouble runs in packs.<br><br>If you haven't figured it out already, I know every detail of this story because I lived in that house. The story is my own. I was the twelve-year-old boy who moved from one world to the next, and back again. That was how I saw and experienced my life. That doesn't mean that my perception is correct or is how the other five members of my family would describe it. Every family member's experience and perceptions are different, but you can bet that everything each member thinks, does or feels bears on every other person in the family.<br><br>Although it isn't much fun to recall, I'm telling you this story because it's one I lived, and one I can say with great confidence illustrates that family matters. Family matters because it is the single most outcome-determinative factor shaping one's outlook and achievement. Your family powerfully determined what you've become and how you think about yourself, and so it will be for your own children. That's why among all words in the English language, none means more to human beings than "family."<br><br>In a typical family of four, there are five distinct personalities because you must also count the collective one. Your family's collective personality is a bundle of all the personalities, subsystems, roles and rules that exist, values embraced, the togetherness (or lack of) in which you live, standards and expectations and the thoughts and beliefs you share. The collective personality of your family can affirm and build on what you have to start with or it can countermand and erode the family unit.<br><br>If you want to understand your children, you must think of your family as a system. Whether we're talking about a family with a husband, wife and children, a single-parent family, a blended family, a gay or lesbian family or a multigenerational family with grandparents living in the home, a family is a system, not just a collection of individuals. If you were to look up "system" in the dictionary, you'd see it defined as "a regularly interacting or interdependent group of items forming a unified whole." To understand this concept, think of the systems at work in everyday life -- even your own body, which is made up of a number of interacting parts. For example, if you rupture a disc in your lower back, you may experience what is called referred pain in your legs, and even in the bottom of your feet. No part works in isolation; the function or dysfunction of even one part affects the whole.<br><br>The same is true of a family. In a family where the mother is diagnosed with cancer, her disease is not simply a personal problem; it's a family problem because the entire family is affected. Whenever something happens to a family member, whether it is cancer, substance abuse, an addiction, a chronic illness or failures in life's pursuits, no family member can avoid being touched by it.<br><br>These events dramatically impact a child's socialization -- the ability to learn, be independent, get along with others and understand the importance of rules. Moreover, it impacts academic progress and the building of self-esteem.<br><br>Socialization is one of the most important jobs a family has. When the family fails to provide the healthy nurturing children need, the impact on their lives can be destabilizing and can cheat them out of the chance to be the best person they can be. Children who are not properly socialized have problems in the world. They do not respect the authority, hierarchy or boundaries of their parents. They have poor impulse control. They can be selfish and extremely demanding, with little regard for how their behavior hurts the family. The resultant dysfunction of unsocialized children simultaneously contaminates the very family that may well have spawned their troubles. A vicious cycle, to be sure.<br><br>Of course, who and what you have become is also dictated by your education and your relationships with your friends, neighbors and employers. And as previously pointed out, a huge influence is the massive media machine -- five hundred TV channels, the Internet, the radio, the newspapers. If you don't think so, just consider the now-unequivocal evidence that violent television and films, video games and music increase aggressive and violent behavior in children, teenagers and even adults.<br><br>Yet for all that, the family -- your family -- remains the most powerful influencing factor. Your past experiences may make you want your family to not be such a powerful influence on who you are or who you become, but it is, whether you like it or not. Bottom line: We need to get it right, right now.<br><br>THE NOBILITY OF PARENTING<br><br>As a parent, you're the head of your family, and therefore you occupy an unbelievably powerful role in shaping the tone, texture, mood and quality of this interconnected and vitally important unit. You're a system manager. By successfully managing this system, you can parent your way to a phenomenal family -- and avoid the problems and erosion seen in so many of the families in your very own neighborhood.<br><br>But let me ask you:<br><br>� What kind of family manager have you been up until now?<br><br>� Are you working on a day-to-day basis at managing your family, treating it as a project, giving it the priority it deserves?<br><br>� Are you creating a family environment that brings out the best in your child?<br><br>� Do you have the skills necessary to give your child his or her best chance at succeeding in this world?<br><br>� Have you overcome any "family legacy" that has contaminated the way in which you define and parent your family?<br><br>� If the other parent is in the home or active in the children's lives post-divorce, do the two of you have a parenting plan that provides guidance based on consistent values?<br><br>� Do you have a plan and an objective in mind for what successful parenting is and will yield in your child's life?<br><br>� Have you created an environment that generates feelings of safety, security, belongingness, self-confidence and strength for the child or children in your charge?<br><br>� Is your family nurturing your child's individuality and acting to ensure that he or she will become the unique and authentic person God intended?<br><br>I know you just answered those questions, but I ask you to go back and read them over again, and this time answer them keeping in mind that you are writing your children's future with your answers. Those questions are just a beginning of the self-examination you must be willing to do if you're going to strengthen the foundation on which your children are basing their lives.

As it turns out, the pirates can't read, so Edward reads the book aloud to them.

Akin to classics like Aldo Leopold's <em>A Sand County Almanac</em> and Annie Dillard's <em>Pilgrim at Tinker Creek,</em> the book forms an eloquent bridge between ecology and memory, science and art. Traver alternates between remembrances of the Cape Cod salt marsh where he spent his boyhood summers and the history of Sippewissett, a place that has been studied by many of America's great biologists, from Louis Agassiz to Rachel Carson.</p> <p>There is poetry in his retelling of the past, a childhood of mud and tides and water; there is great love in the peace and satisfaction he finds later in life fishing and clamming and watching his own children discover the secrets of the marsh. Traver manages to weave these personal details into mesmerizing historical passages and meditations on the ecology of place that read like whodunits; one discovery leads to another, from the most beautiful dance of life to more somber considerations, such as the way the marsh can tell us so much about our environmental crises.<br> <em>Sippewissett</em> is an intimate exploration of place by a man of science and strong family bonds. Here is one of ecology's most studied places through the eyes of someone determined to make sense of its beauty and complexity--at once private and public--filled with poetry yet grounded in science, a place disappearing in the face of development and global climate change.</p></p><p>"Traver has written something truly lovely here; it combines the best sort of science writing, and aspects of Leopold, Dillard, and Carson are certainly echoed within its pages. But beyond that, it also calls to mind family memoirs like George Howe Colt's luminous Big House and makes readers yearn for a place on the shore, a place like Sippewissett. If nothing else, it certainly makes you realize the significance of these places to who we are and what we deem important. Traver writes with great eloquence about relationships with the land, old friendships, and family and the special significance of one small stretch of land in Massachusetts. Sippewissett is a lovely book, and reading it is truly a wonder." - Bookslut review, November 2006 <p>"Rarely can so much be so happily learned. Tim Traver takes us deep into the microcosm of Sippewissett, but more so, explores with us the idea of home. Trevor leaps into his salt creek home and where it takes him is never dull." --Janisse Ray, Ecology of a Cracker Childhood and Pinhook: Finding Wholeness in a Fragmented Land </p><p>"Tim Traver's Sippewissett is a brilliant accomplishment replete with insight, wisdom, understanding, and passion. The author marvelously combines natural history, science, culture, conservation, and enduring qualities of the human spirit. The reader is continually moved by Traver's eloquent blending of personal narrative and rational reflection; we find ourselves traveling with the author through his coming of age cum personal and professional odyssey. This is a book that is likely to endure, enrich, and inform for many years to come." --Stephen Kellert, Tweedy Ordway Professor of Social Ecology, Yale University School of Forestry and Environmental Studies </p><p>"Sippewissett is a salt marsh with history, and Tim Traver is an ideal guide who steers his readers through layers of birth natural and human, personal and expansive. The science of home is a noble pursuit, and Cape Cod has spawned some of our finest literary naturalists. With Sippewissett Traver joins the legacy of gifted seaside storytellers John Hay, Henry Beston, Henry David Thoreau, and Robert Finch." --Ted Levin, author of Liquid Land: A Journey Through the Florida Everglades, winner of the 2004 Burroughs Medal </p><p>"This lovely book made me miss a bus. The sounds of the motor and the opening doors were lost in the ebb and flow of saltwater, migratory fish, and family, and in Traver's combination of humor and natural history with a deep meditation on the ecology of home." -John Elder, author of Reading the Mountains of Home</p>When did the land actually stop being sacred to us? Did anyone record the moment or rather was it a dimming of awareness across years? Did we become modern producer-consumers by misattention, caught by time and opportunity while our meanings changed? Is that how we lost our way, moving nowhere but toward progress? Or is the land still sacred to us, and we just have to turn over more stones to know it? <p>&#x2014;Sippewissett</p></p><h2>The Plague Dogs: A Novel</h2><p>"Thousands and thousands of people will love this book!"<br>THE BOSTON GLOBE<br>A lyrical, engrossing tale, by the author of WATERSHIP DOWN, Richard Adams creates a lyrical and engrossing tale, a remarkable journey into the hearts and minds of two canine heroes, Snitter and Rowf, fugitives from the horrors of an animal research center who escape into the isolation--and terror--of the wilderness.</p><p>11 1.5-hour cassettesRichard Adams is the author of many bestselling novels, including <i>Watership Down</i> (1974), <i>Shardik</i> (1976), <i>The Plague Dogs</i> (1978), <i>The Girl in a Swing</i> (1980), <i>Maia</i> (1985), and <i>Traveller</i> (1988), as well as several works of nonfiction, including his autobiographical <i>The Day Gone By</i> (1991).

Who doesn&#x2019;t claim kinship with them? Humankind is what it is because they shaped our destiny. He is the father of our people, she the mother. Everything leads us back to them. The promised land bears their seal. Faith&#x2014;our faith&#x2014;was kindled by theirs. A couple unlike any other, they inspire joy and hope. Tormented by our own troubles, we recall theirs, which give ours a transcendent meaning. Abraham, the first to be chosen, the first to choose God and crown him God of the universe; Abraham, synonymous with loyalty and absolute fidelity, a symbol of perfection. And yet . . . a shadow hovers over one aspect of his existence. In his exalted life, we encounter a painful episode that cannot but puzzle us, if not cause us to recoil. I refer, of course, to his behavior toward his maid, concubine, or companion, Hagar, and their son, Ishmael.<br><br>Let us read the text, shall we? It tells us that Sarah, poor Sarah, is barren. She cannot conceive. Unhappy above all for her husband, who desires a son and heir, she proposes that he have this child with his Egyptian servant, Hagar. Jewish women being good matchmakers, the shiddukh is successful. Abraham and Hagar are together, Hagar becomes pregnant&#x2014;and that is when the problems start: the servant becomes disrespectful toward her mistress, who takes offense. Eventually, a persecuted Hagar takes flight. Proud, she prefers to die in the desert rather than remain a slave in Sarah&#x2019;s house. By chance, an angel notices her and advises her to return home. Hagar obeys, goes back to Abraham, and gives birth to Ishmael. Fourteen years later, Sarah finally gives birth to her own son: Isaac. What must happen, happens: When Ishmael, like any other boy, plays tricks on his young sibling, Sarah arranges for Hagar and her son to be sent away for good.<br><br>The text, of course, is more detailed and contains some astonishing descriptions: Sarah&#x2019;s state of mind, Hagar&#x2019;s character, Abraham&#x2019;s behavior&#x2014;it&#x2019;s all there. Sometimes a single word suffices to paint a vivid picture; a silence conveys the ambiguity of a situation. The more we reread the story, the more it troubles us. It makes us feel ill at ease. We wish it had happened somewhere else, in another book, in someone else&#x2019;s memory. It has no place in ours. How is it possible? Can Jewish history really begin with a domestic quarrel between an elderly matron and her young maid? And if so, why did the Bible preserve it?<br><br>Naturally, none of this would have happened had Sarah not been childless for so many years. But then, why was she? Why did she have to be so afflicted?<br><br>Actually, there are those who answer that Sarah has this in common with other matriarchs who had the misfortune of being bar- ren at first. The reason? One midrashic author offers a generous explanation&#x2014;generous, that is, to the husbands, the patriarchs. This author says that pregnant, the most beautiful wives appear less attractive because they lose their figures. So to be desirable to the patriarchs for as long as possible, the matriarchs had no children for years and years. A compassionate and courteous Midrash adds that Sarah, when she became a mother at the age of ninety, still had the looks of a young bride on her wedding night.<br><br>In other words, the entire tragedy of Hagar and Ishmael would not have happened if God&#x2014;or the text&#x2014;had not decided to cater to the masculine pride of our forefather Abraham. Is it possible? Is it plausible? Let us not forget: if Sarah had given birth to a son earlier, immediately after her marriage, Hagar would have remained a servant, Ishmael would not have been born&#x2014;and Israel, today, would not have an Arab problem.<br><br>But let&#x2019;s be serious: this story unfolds on a higher level; it has a deeper meaning. Nothing in Jewish destiny is frivolous. All doors open on metaphysical dilemmas and conflicts.<br><br>Let us begin at the beginning. Abraham is not yet called Abraham, but Abram. Sarah is known as Sarai. They are a lonely couple whose life seems rather turbulent. Abraham has left the home of his parents to follow the path leading to God&#x2014;a dangerous path, full of obstacles and traps. Famine and wars succeed each other, as do divine promises. Except the earthly troubles are more real. Abraham does not stop: his life is one long battle. Against neighboring kings, against the powerful unbelievers, against the cruel nature of some people, against drought. Nothing comes easy to him. Everywhere he must fight, but everywhere he wins. After all, isn&#x2019;t God on his side? And yet, on one front, he feels beaten: he has no child. But God has made promises&#x2014;solemn promises! We can imagine his grief: with no son, no heir, what kind of future is there? Who will continue his work? We can understand Sarah&#x2019;s grief: when they were young, they had hope&#x2014;each day, each night could bring good news. Now, after so many years, it is more and more difficult to imagine, more improbable, and&#x2014;why not?&#x2014;even impossible. Uncertainty, anguish, agony without end.<br><br>Then Sarah, in a characteristic gesture of empathy, offers to lend her servant Hagar to her old husband. Hagar is young, she will bear him a child. Perhaps a son. Thus Abraham will be the father of a child even if she, Sarah, will not be the mother. Abraham does not refuse. Hagar, with pregnancy, becomes arrogant; Sarah makes her pay dearly. Hagar flees, returns, gives birth to Ishmael, and remains for fifteen years&#x2014;long enough to witness the birth of Isaac, whose arrival overshadows all else. Then comes the final drama: the breakup, the explosion between the two women, the two brothers, and, above all, between father and son. Sarah demands that her husband expel Hagar and Ishmael, who provoke her. Abraham hesitates. Ishmael is his son; he feels he has neither the right nor the strength to drive him away into the unknown. Divine intervention is needed to make him decide. But what about pity in all this? And compassion? And the human heart and Jewish morality?<br><br>These are troubling, painful, baffling questions. And there are others, many others. All of them inevitable. They call into question the actions of the entire cast of characters. Who are they? A father&#x2014;Abraham. Two mothers&#x2014;Sarah and Hagar. Two sons&#x2014;Ishmael and Isaac. Is that all? Surely not. For God&#x2014;yes, He too&#x2014;plays an essential role in the evolving plot. Except for Him, all the characters seem to be real, living beings, so detailed and colorful are their features.<br><br>Abraham: submissive in his relationship to God, sure of himself in his relationship with those around him. He obeys heaven but is obeyed on earth. We perceive him as moody, impulsive, used to giving orders. Strong, invincible. He appears vulnerable only with Sarah. Inflexible with others, he is patient with his wife. He was able to resist his father, Terah, but Sarah is irresistible. Whatever she desires, she obtains. It is Sarah, not Abraham, who comes up with the idea of a match with Hagar. Abraham never would have dreamed of living with another woman. He loves Sarah. Too much perhaps. She is his strength and perhaps his weakness as well.<br><br>At this point, an obscure incident ought to be recalled. It happened in Egypt which the two visited as tourists&#x2014;though their interest was not tourism, but food. At home, in Canaan, people were starving. An unexpected problem confronted Abraham and Sarah in Egypt: the king Avimelekh fell in love with her. It was love at first sight. And Abraham knew that kings usually get their way. Avimelekh could easily eliminate the cumbersome husband and keep the widow. So Abraham, with her consent, introduced Sarah everywhere as his sister. She spent a whole night with the king who, lo and behold, thanks to heavenly intervention, was struck by some illness and was unable to touch her.<br><br>This strange episode smacks of unpleasantness; it has always left me uneasy. Yet instead of separating the couple, it strengthens their bond. Bravo, but we still don&#x2019;t understand Abraham: Fearful? For his life? And what about his honor? How could he abandon his wife&#x2014;his adored, beloved wife&#x2014;to the whims of a king who has an eye for women, especially strange women, other men&#x2019;s women? How could a hero like Abraham&#x2014;who had defeated five kings&#x2014;yield to a single one without so much as a fight? How is it possible that a man of his stature thinks only of saving his own skin? Admittedly, he is preoccupied with theological questions, but is there no loyalty in him, not to mention chivalry?<br><br>We shall ask these same questions with regard to Hagar and Ishmael. Abraham drives them away? He who is famous for his hospitality? For love of his wife he sacrifices his son? For sacrifice is what we are talking about! He sends them into the desert, where death surely awaits them. How can he be so cruel toward a woman who has loved him, be it for one night only&#x2014;and toward a child, his own child at that! Sarah doesn&#x2019;t like them&#x2014;good, let them stay at a neighbor&#x2019;s. Let them go and live with some distant tribe! But why condemn them to death? How are we to explain these flaws in Abraham&#x2019;s character? To what shall we attribute them? Is this the same Abraham whose faith and goodness remain models for all time? Could he have committed such acts of heartlessness?<br><br>Let us read again the passage about the second character in the drama&#x2014;Sarah. We shall see that she too doesn&#x2019;t come off too well in a second reading. Negative traits appear. In Egypt, she is a willing accomplice in her husband&#x2019;s play-acting. Like a couple illegally crossing some dangerous border, together they try to cheat the police. But have the police nothing better to do than wait for Sarah? Thousands upon thousands must be pouring into the region in search of food&#x2014;and Sarah alone is threatened?

Sharon Weinberger gives us a riveting account of DARPA&#x2019;s successes and failures, its remarkable innovations, and its wild-eyed schemes. We see how the threat of nuclear Armageddon sparked investment in computer networking, leading to the Internet, as well as to a proposal to power a missile-destroying particle beam by draining the Great Lakes. We learn how DARPA was responsible during the Vietnam War for both Agent Orange and the development of the world&#x2019;s first armed drones, and how after 9/11 the agency sparked a national controversy over surveillance with its data-mining research. And we see how DARPA&#x2019;s success with self-driving cars was followed by disappointing contributions to the Afghanistan and Iraq wars.<br><br>Weinberger has interviewed more than one hundred former Pentagon officials and scientists involved in DARPA&#x2019;s projects&#x2014;many of whom have never spoken publicly about their work with the agency&#x2014;and pored over countless declassified records from archives around the country, documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, and exclusive materials provided by sources. <i>The Imagineers of War</i> is a compelling and groundbreaking history in which science, technology, and politics collide.</p><p><b>SHARON WEINBERGER</b> is Executive Editor at <i>Foreign Policy </i>and the author of <i>Imaginary Weapons: A Journey Through the Pentagon's Scientific Underworld</i>.

In these five new chapters from his life, he is still at bay, pursued by the hounds of desire and anxiety, of unbridled criticism and publicity in a literary world ever more cheerfully crass. He fights intimations of annihilation in still-Communist Czechoslovakia, while promiscuously consorting with dissidents, apparatchiks, and Midwestern Republicans. Next, he succumbs to the temptations of power by accepting the presidency of a quaint and cosseted honorary body patterned on the Acad�mie Fran�aise. Then, the reader finds him on trial in California and on a criminal rampage in a gothic Gotham, abetted by a nubile sidekick called Robin. Lastly, our septuagenarian veteran of the literary wars is rewarded with a coveted medal, stunning him into a well-deserved silence. It's not easy being Henry Bech in the post-Gutenbergian world, but somebody has to do it, and he brings to the task an indomitable mixture of grit and ennui.</p><p>After recounting almost every detail of Rabbit Angstrom's mental, spiritual, and (especially) erotic life for almost four decades, John Updike laid his brilliant creation to rest in 1990. Another of his ongoing characters, however, has remained at large--Henry Bech. In <i>Bech at Bay</i>, Updike revives his philandering Jewish American novelist for one last trip through that wringer we call the writer's life. Like his creator, Bech is getting on in years. And although age cannot wither his considerable sexual appetites nor custom stale his cantankerous charms, he is uncomfortably aware of his mortality. In the first episode, during a visit to pre-<i>perestroika</i> Czechoslovakia, the "semi-obscure American author" is taken to view Kafka's grave, and the sight gives him the willies: "It all struck Bech as dumbfoundingly blunt and engimatic, banal and moving. Such blankness, such stony and peaceable reification, waits for us at the bottom of things." His own proximity to the bottom of things is what gives <i>Bech at Bay</i> an extra dose of sobriety. For the first time, Updike's ingratiating impersonation of a Jew--who shares the author's lapidary style, sizable nose, and not much else--is not only supremely amusing but moving.<p> Which isn't to say that all is gloomy in Bechville. Updike keeps things breezy throughout, as his hero is seduced and subpoenaed, excoriated and honored, finally, with the Nobel Prize. Only once does the author lose his footing, with "Bech Noir": this world-class nebbish just doesn't cut it as serial killer, and even the prose goes untypically to pot. But otherwise the book is a delight, venting all the nastiness about literary life that Updike always purges from his own more genteel (not to mention Gentile) persona. It's also an elegant meditation on literary being and nothingness. "A character," we are told, "suffers from the fear that he will become boring to the author, who will simply let him drop, without so much as a terminal illness or a dramatic tumble down the Reichenbach Falls in the arms of Professor Moriarty. For some years now, Bech had felt his author wanting to set him aside, to get him off the desk forever." Here Updike proves himself Nabokov's equal in the metafictional sweepstakes--and makes us hope that his doppelg�nger will get one last reprieve. <i>--James Marcus</i></p><i>Bech at Bay</i> is brilliant"<br>--David Lodge, <i>New York Review of Books</i><p>"A comic delight...the ultimate wasp has produced another wonderful piece of Jewish fiction.

As Steven Hahn demonstrates, rural African-Americans were central political actors in the great events of disunion, emancipation, and nation-building. At the same time, Hahn asks us to think in more expansive ways about the nature and boundaries of politics and political practice. </p><p> Emphasizing the importance of kinship, labor, and networks of communication, <i>A Nation under Our Feet</i> explores the political relations and sensibilities that developed under slavery and shows how they set the stage for grassroots mobilization. Hahn introduces us to local leaders, and shows how political communities were built, defended, and rebuilt. He also identifies the quest for self-governance as an essential goal of black politics across the rural South, from contests for local power during Reconstruction, to emigrationism, biracial electoral alliances, social separatism, and, eventually, migration. </p><p> Hahn suggests that Garveyism and other popular forms of black nationalism absorbed and elaborated these earlier struggles, thus linking the first generation of migrants to the urban North with those who remained in the South.

Eating well, any doctor will tell you, is the best way to take care of yourself. Feeding well, any human will tell you, is the most important job a mother has. But for too many of us, food now feels dangerous. We parse every bite we eat as good or bad, and judge our own worth accordingly. When her newborn daughter stopped eating after a medical crisis, Virginia Sole-Smith spent two years teaching her how to feel safe around food again &#x2015; and in the process, realized just how many of us are struggling to do the same thing. </p><p><i>The Eating Instinct</i> visits kitchen tables around America to tell Sole-Smith&#x2019;s own story, as well as the stories of women recovering from weight loss surgery, of people who eat only nine foods, of families with unlimited grocery budgets and those on food stamps. Every struggle is unique. But Sole-Smith shows how they&#x2019;re also all products of our modern food culture. And they&#x2019;re all asking the same questions: How did we learn to eat this way? Why is it so hard to feel good about food? And how can we make it better?</p></p><p><p><b>Virginia Sole-Smith</b> is a freelance writer whose work has appeared in the <i>New York Times Magazine, Harper's, Slate, </i>and <i>Elle</i>.

Donald Strachey goes to visit a showing of the AIDS memorial quilt, he is surprised to see the name of a friend who is not yet dead, which leads him to believe that someone is protecting a deadly secret</p><p>"A gripping, fast paced mystery." - <i>Booklist</i>No doubt it's an honor to have your square included in the AIDS Memorial Quilt, but one Maynard Sudbury thinks its a little premature in the case of his long-ago lover Jim Suter (``1956-1996''), who isn't dead yet, or even HIV-positive. And Maynard's friend Donald Strachey (Chain of Fools, 1996, etc.) can't help wondering about the import of one design element in Jim's square--several pages of Jim's old campaign bio of right-wing Pennsylvania Congresswoman Betty Krumfutz, especially when Krumfutz is spotted surreptitiously ripping the pages from the square, and Maynard, a foreign correspondent who's survived Hanoi and Beirut, is shot outside his D.C. apartment later that day. Who could've been in such a hurry to bury Jim Suter? Strachey and his lover Timmy Callahan take a closer look at the background of this marvelously unprincipled writer-for-hire and discover any number of people, sporting a nicely variegated bunch of motives, who'd lift a cheerful glass to his passing. In fact, the main mystery here, given the number of corpses past and future--Stevenson is still spinning out complications as the final curtain's descending--may be why Jim Suter hasn't died yet. Solid, satisfyingly paranoid plotting, marred only by its tendency to save the juiciest secrets for the very last act. -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The Vows of Silence, the fourth crime novel featuring Chief Inspector Serrailler, is perhaps even more compulsive and convincing than its predecessors. A gunman is terrorizing young women in the cathedral town of Laffterton. What, if anything, links the apparently random murders? Is the marksman with the rifle the same as the killer with the handgun? With the complexity and character study that earned raves for The Pure in Heart and the relentless pacing and plot twists of The Various Haunts of Men, The Vows of Silence is truly the work of a writer at the top of her form.</p><p><b>Susan Hill</b>&#x2019;s novels and short stories have won the Whitbread Book, Somerset Maugham, and John Llewellyn Rhys Awards, the <i>Yorkshire Pos</i>t Book of the Year, and have been shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize.

Then they had come into the low-hanging curtains of cloud. It had started to drizzle. <br><br>He opened his mouth to make some sour remark about the promise of a fine day, but, at the same moment, Iain turned his head a fraction to the left. Motioned with his forefinger.<br><br>Iain knew the hills and the weather of the hills, the subtle shifts of wind direction. Knew them better than anyone. <br><br>They stood, still, not speaking. There was a tension now. It hadn&#x2019;t been there minutes before.<br><br>Something.<br><br>The sun broke apart the cloud curtain, leaving it in tatters. The sun shone at first with a watery cast but then, like a man leaping out into view, full and strong. The corners of Iain&#x2019;s mouth twitched in a smile.<br><br>But still they stood. Motionless and silent. Waiting.<br><br>Iain lifted his binoculars to his eyes and looked from left to right, slowly, slowly. <br><br>And he waited, watching the set of Iain&#x2019;s head, waiting for the moment.<br><br>Their clothes began to steam in the sun.<br><br>Iain lowered the glasses and nodded.<br>They were above the deer, and for another half-mile he saw nothing. But they were there of course. Iain knew. They went care���fully, keeping upwind. The ground was stony here, easy to slip. <br><br>He felt the old excitement. These were the best moments. When you knew. You were this close to it, this close to having it in your sights, this close to the whole point and purpose and culmination of it all.<br><br>This close.<br><br>There was the faintest outbreath from Iain&#x2019;s pursed lips.<br><br>He followed the line of sight.<br><br>The stag was alone, halfway up the lower slope immediately west of where they were standing. It had sensed nothing &#x2014; that much was clear for the moment. Keep it that way.<br><br>They dropped down and began to crawl, the soaking ground against their bellies, the sun on their backs. The midges came on with a vengeance, to find their way unerringly through chinks in clothing, brushing aside the barrier of citronella, but he was so keyed up now he barely noticed them. Later he would be driven mad.<br><br>They crawled for another ten minutes, dropping down slightly until they were level with the stag and a couple of hundred yards away.<br><br>Iain stopped. Lifted the glasses. They waited. Watched. Still as the stones.<br><br>The sun was hot now. The wind had dropped altogether.<br><br>They began to inch maybe thirty yards further and the thirty yards took ten minutes; they barely moved. Just enough.<br><br>The stag lifted its head. <br><br>&#x2018;The Old Man,&#x2019; Iain whispered, so softly he could barely hear.<br><br>The oldest stag. Not as huge as those living on the lower ground, and without the vast antlers. But mighty enough. Old. Too old for another winter. He had too much respect for the beast to let that happen. <br><br>They were downwind and perhaps a hundred and fifty yards off. But then the stag shook its head, turned side�ways, ambled a little way, though never turning its back. They waited. <br><br>Waited. The sun blazed. He boiled inside his wax jacket. <br><br>Then, casually, it turned and, in a breathtaking second, lifted its head and faced him full on. As if it knew. As if it had been expecting him. It positioned itself perfectly.<br><br>He unslipped his rifle. Loaded. Iain was watching intently through the glasses. <br><br>He balanced himself with care and then looked down the sights. <br><br>The old stag had not moved. Its head was raised higher now and it was looking straight at him.<br><br>It knew.<br><br>Iain waited, frozen to the glasses.<br><br>The world stopped turning.<br><br>He aimed for the heart.<br>Two<br><br>Dark blue jacket. Blue-and-white print skirt. Medium heels.<br><br>Scarf? Or the beads?<br><br>Beads.<br><br>Helen Creedy went into the bathroom and fiddled with her hair. Came out and caught sight of herself again in the full-length mirror. God, she looked &#x2014; frumpish. That was the only word. As if she were going to a job interview.<br><br>She took off the skirt, blouse and jacket and started again. <br><br>It was very warm. Late September, an Indian summer. <br><br>Right. Pale grey linen trousers. Long linen jacket. The fuchsia shirt she hadn&#x2019;t yet worn.<br><br>Better? Yes. Earrings? Just plain studs.<br><br>There was a roar outside as Tom gave his motorbike its usual final rev turning into the drive. The roar died. She heard the clunk of the metal rest going down onto the concrete. <br><br>Just after six o&#x2019;clock. She had hours &#x2014; got dressed far too early.<br><br>She sat down on the end of her bed. She had been excited. Keyed up. Nervous, but with something like pleasure, antici�pation. Now, it was as if the temperature had dropped. She felt sick. Anxious. Afraid. How absurd. Then she felt nothing but a draining tiredness so that she could not imagine ever having the energy to stand on her feet again. <br><br>The kitchen door slammed. She heard Tom drop his helmet and heavy leather gloves onto the floor. <br><br>Pale grey linen. New fuchsia shirt. She had even had her hair done. She wanted to lie down on her bed and sleep and sleep.<br><br>After another couple of minutes she went downstairs.<br><br>&#x2018;Oh, good choice, Ma.&#x2019; Elizabeth looked up from her French textbook. <br><br>Tom, as always when he got in, was at the toaster. Tom. He had said he was &#x2018;OK&#x2019; about it. &#x2018;Fine&#x2019; about it. But Helen still wondered.<br><br>She had nothing to worry about with Elizabeth, though &#x2014; it was her daughter who had pushed her into this in the first place. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s six years since Dad. You won&#x2019;t have us here for much longer. You&#x2019;ve got to get a life, Ma.&#x2019;<br><br>But now she caught a look on Tom&#x2019;s face which was at odds with what he said. That he was &#x2018;OK&#x2019; about it. &#x2018;Fine.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I thought you weren&#x2019;t meeting this guy till eight.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Half seven.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;All the same.&#x2019;<br><br>Tom scraped what looked like half a pound of butter and a dollop of Marmite across four slices of toast.<br><br>The kitchen got the evening sun. It was warm. Elizabeth&#x2019;s French books. Pens. Markers. Tom&#x2019;s Marmite pot, lidless on the table. The smell of warm toast. And bike oil.<br><br>&#x2018;I can&#x2019;t go,&#x2019; Helen said. &#x2018;I can&#x2019;t do this. What am I thinking?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Oh God, not again, we&#x2019;ve been through all this. Tom, tell her, back me up, will you?&#x2019;<br><br>Tom shrugged. <br><br>His sister snorted impatiently. Put her pen down on <i>Eug�nie Grandet</i>. &#x2018;Right, let&#x2019;s start again. Is it just first-night nerves or what?&#x2019;<br><br>First-night nerves? How did that even begin to convey what she was feeling, sitting at the kitchen table in pale grey linen and a fuchsia shirt she had never worn and at least an hour too early?<br>It was a couple of months ago that Elizabeth had said, as they were walking Mutley, on the Hill, &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t think you&#x2019;re meeting people.&#x2019;<br><br>Helen had not understood. In her job as a pharmacist she met people every day. <br><br>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t mean that.&#x2019; Elizabeth had sat down and leaned her back against the Wern Stone. It was July. Mutley lay panting.<br><br>Helen had hesitated, standing, looking at the view over Lafferton so as not to look at her daughter. She sensed that something was important, or that things were about to change but she did not know what or how. It alarmed her. <br><br>&#x2018;Mum, don&#x2019;t you think you might . . . well, meet someone &#x2014; I mean, someone else. After Dad. Sit down, I&#x2019;m getting a crick in my neck here.&#x2019;<br><br>Helen sat on the dry grass. Elizabeth was looking straight at her. She had always been like this. Helen remembered the night she had been born: Lizzie had looked straight at her in this same, uncompromising way, even though newborn babies were not supposed to focus. She had done it as a small girl when asking a question. That straight, blue-eyed gaze that held you and did not let you off. Here it was now. <br><br>&#x2018;Before you know it I&#x2019;ll be at Cambridge, fingers crossed. Tom will be off with his weirdos.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;And I&#x2019;ll be on my own and I won&#x2019;t be able to function is what you mean.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Not exactly.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;What then?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I worry that you&#x2019;re missing out. You should have someone.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t want to be married again.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;How do you know? You may not want to in theory . . . but if you met someone.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Well who&#x2019;s to say I won&#x2019;t?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Not stuck in a windowless cubbyhole full of pill packets you won&#x2019;t.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I like my job.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s not the point. Look, I think you should take a more proactive approach to this thing.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;There is no &#x201c;thing&#x201d;. Come on, Mutley&#x2019;s too hot. So am I.&#x2019;<br><br>She stood. But when Lizzie also stood, there it was, the direct gaze. Not letting her off. Helen had turned and started back down the Hill so fast she almost slipped on the stony track.<br><br>*<br><br>She had not wanted to think about it. She wouldn&#x2019;t think about it. She was perfectly contented. She had met Terry when she was twenty-three, married him a year later, had the children, been happy. When Tom was six she had gone back to work, part-time. Life had been good. <br><br>When Terry had been diagnosed with malignant melanoma she was told he would have a couple of years, maybe more. He had had four months. Any sort of relationship with any other man had been &#x2014; was &#x2014; unthinkable. She realised as she reached the last few yards of the track that she was angry, angry and in some sort of panic. <br><br>&#x2018;I think &#x2014;&#x2019; Elizabeth said, catching up with her.<br><br>&#x2018;Well, I don&#x2019;t. Leave it. It is not a conversation I am prepared to have.&#x2019; She had spoken harshly but Elizabeth had simply gazed at her for a long moment without replying.<br>Two days later, a brochure came through the post. <br><br><i>&#x2018;My name is Laura Brooke. I run the Laura Brooke agency for men and women wishing to meet a partner hand-picked for them. I do not believe people can be matched by computers. I act as a friend. I only take on clients with whom I feel I can succeed and I only introduce clients to one another after extensive interviews and my own personal and careful consideration. I give clients my time and expertise to find them . . .&#x2019;</i><br><br>She had stuffed the brochure in the bin. <br><br>The following day in the hairdresser&#x2019;s, she was startled to find herself wondering if people really did meet successfully through agencies or via the Internet, if the whole thing was possibly not the con she had always assumed it to be. Sad people went to dating agencies, sad or sinister people. She could understand why you might join something or other if you were, say, new to a town and had no way of making friends &#x2014; a club, a sports group, a night class. But friendship was one thing, this was another. She had friends. What she didn&#x2019;t have was enough time to spend with them. <br><br>She was forty-six. By the time she was fifty Tom and Elizabeth would have left home. She would have her job and also more time for her friends. She would have the St Michael&#x2019;s Singers and she might rejoin the Lafferton Players. She would volunteer for something.<br><br>Terry was irreplaceable. His death had devastated her and she still felt like someone who had lost a limb. Nothing would ever change that. Nothing and no one.<br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m not going,&#x2019; she said now. &#x2018;I can&#x2019;t do this.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;You are and you can, if I have to push you there.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Elizabeth . . .&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Once, you said, just once when someone seemed really worth meeting. And he does. We agreed. Tom, didn&#x2019;t we agree?&#x2019;<br><br>Tom put his hands up. &#x2018;Leave me out of this, OK?&#x2019; he said, banging out of the room.<br><br>&#x2018;He doesn&#x2019;t like it,&#x2019; Helen said.<br><br>&#x2018;He doesn&#x2019;t like anything that isn&#x2019;t about his own peculiar world. Ignore him.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Why are you pushing me into something I don&#x2019;t want?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;You do want it. You want to get out of here, you want to open yourself up to something new. You want a fresh start.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s only one date.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Exactly!&#x2019;<br>A part of her knew that Elizabeth was right. Helen had thought about it a good deal, once she had allowed the idea house room. She was fearful of being too much alone when her children had left home, she was too young to be in a rut, she needed to open herself to something new. All the same, to her, meeting someone through an agency or a dating website, or by answering an advert, was an admission of failure. And she wasn&#x2019;t sure she even wanted to succeed. Besides, there was a stigma, when someone of her age did this.<br><br>&#x2018;Rubbish,&#x2019; Lizzie had said.<br>Of course it was a stigma. If she did &#x2014; by remote chance &#x2014; meet someone through a dating agency, and that someone came to be important, she would never be able to tell anyone how they had got together. She would cut out her tongue rather than admit it. <br><br>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t get it.&#x2019; But that was Elizabeth and she was her daughter.<br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll send a text message and say I&#x2019;m not well.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;That is absolutely pathetic. For God&#x2019;s sake, Ma, this is a drink in a pub &#x2014;&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;A bar.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;A drink. A chat. You can leave it there. Oh God, we&#x2019;ve been through all this &#x2014; if you get the feeling he&#x2019;s a mass murderer, you send Tom a text and he&#x2019;ll be there in five.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I won&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;s a mass murderer. He sounds . . .&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Like a nice bloke.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Yes.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Yes.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;You must have wanted to go through with it earlier, you got ready hours ago.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Is this too dressed up?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;No, it&#x2019;s great. That wasn&#x2019;t my point.&#x2019;<br><br>There was a long silence. <br><br>&#x2018;I do want to go. I want to. But I don&#x2019;t want to. I just haven&#x2019;t done anything like it before and it&#x2019;s so many years since I even had an evening out with a man . . .&#x2019;<br><br>Elizabeth got up, came round the table and gave her a hug, bending over her as if she were the mother, Helen the child.<br><br>&#x2018;You look great and it&#x2019;s going to be fine. And if it isn&#x2019;t &#x2014; so what? What have you lost? One evening.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;EastEnders.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Well, that&#x2019;s crap at the moment so there you are.&#x2019;<br><br>Elizabeth settled down to Eug�nie Grandet again. The room went quiet.<br><br>&#x2018;Lizzie . . .&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Mother &#x2014; <i>go away</i>!&#x2019;<br>She had retrieved the agency brochure from the waste-paper bin.

The most popular team belonged to an institution called the Carlisle Indian Industrial School. Its story begins with Lt. Col. Richard Henry Pratt, a fierce abolitionist who believed that Native Americans deserved a place in American society. In 1879, Pratt made a treacherous journey to the Dakota Territory to recruit Carlisle&#x2019;s first students. <br><br>Years later, three students approached Pratt with the notion of forming a football team. Pratt liked the idea, and in less than twenty years the Carlisle football team was defeating their Ivy League opponents and in the process changing the way the game was played.<br>&nbsp;<br>Sally Jenkins gives this story of unlikely champions a breathtaking immediacy. We see the legendary Jim Thorpe kicking a winning field goal, watch an injured Dwight D. Eisenhower limping off the field, and follow the glorious rise of Coach Glenn &#x201c;Pop&#x201d; Warner as well as his unexpected fall from grace.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>The Real All Americans</i> is about the end of a culture and the birth of a game that has thrilled Americans for generations. It is an inspiring reminder of the extraordinary things that can be achieved when we set aside our differences and embrace a common purpose.</p></p><p><p>SALLY JENKINS is an award-winning journalist for the <i>Washington Post</i> and the author of eight books, three of which were <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, most notably <i>It&#x2019;s Not About the Bike </i>with Lance Armstrong.

Fetterman was dun&#x2013;colored and bare, with no cover save for some broken rocks that looked as if they had been thrown down by a short&#x2013;tempered God. There was just one other visible thing on the expanse, the faint double track of the Bozeman Trail, heading off into the immensity that would become Wyoming. The trail sketched westward along a ridge, ragged but decipherable, its ruts worn into the ground by a succession of iron&#x2013;rimmed wheels bearing the weight of American ambition. <br><br>Fetterman and his command of eighty men pushed over the hill and fanned out, barely holding their formation as they chased a handful of Lakota warriors mounted on ponies just ahead, baiting them. The impatient cavalrymen surged forward on their chesty Army horses. Infantrymen grabbed at their stirrups and ran along, trying to keep up. <br><br>The braves drawing the soldiers on had been chosen to lead the attack for their exceptional bravery and fighting skills. One of them was Crazy Horse, not yet famous. Another was a patrician twentysix&#x2013;year&#x2013;old Oglala&#x2013;Lakota named American Horse, a burgeoning leader who was participating in one of the many conflicts with whites that would engage him for the rest of his life. (1)<br><br>American Horse and his fellow decoys beckoned the soldiers with a variety of ruses. They galloped back and forth on ponies, screeching insults and firing occasional shots. They waved blankets at the cavalry horses, hoping to frighten them into bolting. Every now and then, one of the Indians would appear to tire. He would slow and walk his pony, seeming fatigued. This was another feint, perhaps the most tempting of all. The bluecoats hurried after them, down the Bozeman Trail.<br><br>Below, hidden in hollows and gullies on either side of the trail, fully two thousand Oglala, Cheyenne, and Arapaho warriors awaited the soldiers. They crouched in long grasses, wallows, and swales, holding the lariats of their ponies. Strapped to their bodies were a variety of knives, hatchets, bows, and brilliantly painted shields. They clenched war clubs made of rough triangular rocks bound to heavy wood handles. A few of them had rifles, but mainly they carried bows and arrows, thousands of arrows. (2)<br><br>The isolation and the unfamiliarity of the ground should have made Fetterman pause. The geography of the Dakota Territory alone was forbidding. It was just that&#x2013;territory, not a state or a county, but an indistinct region where the Gilded Age stopped. It was a sunburned and epic American Serengeti, a series of rolling mounds and weather&#x2013;tortured prairie ridges that stretched as far as the eye could see, covered by scorched hay&#x2013;colored grasses, only occasionally interrupted by weird rock outcroppings and misshapen trees. Out here, the world was still large and mysterious; not everything had been discovered, surveyed, charted, explained, and blueprinted.<br><br>It was a magnificent setting, but an austere one, and it provoked deep apprehension in one Army wife. The country was pervaded by &#x201c;an almost overpowering sense of stillness,&#x201d; wrote Frances Grummond, whose husband, George, was a cavalry lieutenant riding with Fetterman, &#x201c;especially at night when conversation could be heard and understood at a long distance.&#x201d; Frances had felt a deep sense of dread since her arrival just a few months earlier. Every cloud seemed to dim the entire landscape; every crack of a rifle in the night seemed to explode right by her bed. &#x201c;Every sound exacted attention.&#x201d; (3)<br><br>The post that Fetterman and his men had ridden out from, Fort Phil Kearny, was hardly a stronghold. Rather, it was an unfinished, frighteningly remote stockade of newly hewn logs, just six months old, and it sat squarely alone in the middle of a six&#x2013;hundred&#x2013;mile tract of Lakota country. It was undermanned and underarmed, with just 640 troops, most of them inexperienced recruits. The nearest reinforcements could be summoned only with a four&#x2013;day, death&#x2013;defying gallop to Fort Laramie.<br><br>Fort Phil Kearny had been built in this forsaken locale to protect the Bozeman Trail, the hazardous new shortcut to the gold fields of Montana, forged by prospector John M. Bozeman in 1864 right through the heart of the Powder River country and Lakota hunting grounds. In just two years, the trail had become an enormously popular route west, with thousands of emigrants trekking along it, homesteaders bound for Oregon, gold seekers, fortune hunters, ranchers, farmers, and trappers. They all clamored for protection, and that spring the U.S. government acceded and sent a force under Colonel Henry B. Carrington to construct a series of garrisons to defend the route, one of them Fort Phil Kearny.<br><br>But in the brief life of the fort, there had already been terrible casualties. Men and livestock were lost almost daily to Lakota raiders, livid over the intrusion of the road and the new fortifications&#x2013;in a sixmonth stretch of 1866 they would kill 154 settlers and soldiers. (4) <br><br>The post commander, Carrington, was increasingly anxious about his vulnerable position. When a woodcutting party was attacked that morning, Carrington issued cautious instructions: Fetterman and his men were to relieve the woodcutters but were not to pursue the Indians beyond the farthest visible ridge, called Lodge Trail.<br><br>Fetterman, however, was not inclined to obey anybody or anything except his own impulse toward bravery. Bristling with whiskers and decorations, he was a hugely confident officer who had been twice brevetted for gallantry in some of the worst fighting of the Civil War. He was the son and nephew of military careerists, with an eye on advancement, and it&#x2019;s likely he chafed at taking orders from Carrington, a painstaking administrative sort who had never been in a major battle. Carrington had been sent west for his efficiency in building the real field 11 forts, not for his fighting abilities. He was fine&#x2013;bearded, sad&#x2013;eyed, and hyperarticulate, and in Fetterman&#x2019;s view weak. &#x201c;We are afflicted with an incompetent commanding officer, viz. Carrington,&#x201d; Fetterman complained in a letter to a friend. (5) <br><br>The mounted men chased the decoys down the slope and along a lengthy shoulder of parched yellow ground. The troops became strung out, their boots and their horses&#x2019; hooves kicking up dust. Occasionally a cavalryman paused and fired a burst from his light carbine rifle. <br><br>Ahead, as the Indians raced across the prairie mounds, they did something curious. Two parties suddenly cut across each other&#x2019;s paths, riding toward each other, and then swerving away again.<br><br>This was the signal for attack.<br><br>On either side of the trail, the warriors rose from the golden brown prairie. It was as if the whole crust of the earth suddenly burst upward. Waves of arrows arced up from the gullies and draws. Pony hooves thrummed over rock and soil. <br><br>Months of preparation and pent-up aggression went into the attack. The battle plan was the work of Red Cloud, leader of the Oglala&#x2013;Lakota. (6) For years, the Lakota had watched whites encroach on their hunting grounds, and they were furiously determined to shut down the new Bozeman passage. In 1840, the first small wagon train of settlers had crossed through to the Pacific. By 1848, huge lines of prairie schooners snaked westward, including Brigham Young&#x2019;s parade of 397 wagons. With them came a variety of pestilences, including Asiatic cholera, measles, and smallpox. (7)<br><br>Most important, they rousted the wildlife, particularly the allproviding buffalo, which gave the Lakota every element of their livelihoods. The Lakota, highly attuned naturalists, had a practical understanding of the famine that could result from the smallest disruption of their hunting patterns, one drought that came across the prairie as if blown from an eagle&#x2013;bone whistle.<br><br>While American Horse couldn&#x2019;t have known the precise facts of white emigration, his own eyes told him that it was becoming a real threat to Lakota sustenance. He understood that, &#x201c;unless the white people could be kept out of the buffalo country, they were doomed, so far as being a free and independent people was concerned. They would have a strange master to look to for existence,&#x201d; according to a white friend, the famed scout, cattleman, and sharpshooter James Cook. (8) <br><br>The Lakota in their dominant years were many things: hunters, natural philosophers, tireless orators, and seekers who felt that the ephemeral was graspable with deep concentration. But they were<br>something else, too, when threatened: absolutely lethal combatants.<br><br>There was no better example than American Horse, the picture of flourishing Lakota male splendor. He was born in 1840, the son of a tribal leader named Sitting Bear, and he was of ancient stock, with a family winter count, the equivalent of a calendar, that went back five generations. His lineage showed in his handsome features, which exuded entitlement, vanity, and resolve. He was tall and deepchested, with a face that looked as though it had been stroked with a knife out of wood. His mouth bowed downward, grim with purpose, and elongating his features were thick plaits falling over his shoulders, wrapped in cloth.<br><br>As a boy, he learned to hunt buffalo through the snow, on foot, with a bow and arrow. From the age of five or six years on, he played the Lakota war games that prepared braves for their adult responsibilities&#x2014; games not unlike football. One of them was a harrowing contest called Throwing Them off Their Horses, a form of mock battle in which mounted boys lined up and charged at each other. As the ponies collided and floundered in a dust cloud, the riders seized each other, wrestling. They played until all of the men on one side were unhorsed.

The new Dynamic Duo hit the streets with a bang in their new flying Batmobile as they face off against an assemblage of villains called the Circus of Strange. They also tackle their first mission investigating a child who&#39;s been abducted by the mysterious Domino Killer. But will everything go smoothly? And who exactly are the new Batman and Robin? The newest era of The Dark Knight begins here!</p><p>Grant Morrison's credits include Arkham Asylum, JLA, Animal Man, Doom Patrol, The Invisibles and The Filth. Frank Quitely has won acclaim for his work on high-profile titles including We3, The Authority, and New X-Men. Philip Tan has illustrated a host of top-selling comics including Batman &amp; Robin, Iron Man, Thor, Spawn and Uncanny X-Men.Following Bruce Wayne's reported demise, this Grand Guignol miniseries shows the competition to fill his role. Dick Grayson, the original Robin, has established a separate crime-fighting identity as Nightwing, but now has donned the iconic cape and mask of Batman. Partnered with bratty, impatient 10-year-old Damian (son of the original Wayne), he wants to modernize Batman's equipment but maintain his high principles. Dick's successor as Robin, Jason Todd, now calls himself the Red Hood and believes that the way to reduce crime is to kill criminals as dramatically as possible. Unfortunately, the Red Hood's violent tactics bring reprisals in the form of the Flamingo, an incredibly vicious South American assassin who enjoys skinning and eating the faces of beautiful young women. Morrison's scripts use this dark material effectively, and the art&#x2014;first by Quitely, then by a team of three&#x2014;is dazzling. In this largely self-contained episode, Morrison expertly retools DC's old superhero machinery. When combined with Quitely, it nearly reaches the heights of the duo's previous <i>All-Star Superman</i>. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

"What is this? What did you say? Someone's giving out candy? Who's giving out candy? EVERYONE WE KNOW is giving out candy? I gotta be a part of this!"<br><br>In his first picture book, comedian and bestselling author Jerry Seinfeld captures on the page his hilarious views on Halloween, from Superman costumes that look like pajamas to the agony of getting bad trick-or-treat candy. Seinfeld's tale resonates with vivid experiences of a night every kid loves.<br><br>Both kids and adults will eat up Jerry's distinct and unwritten rules of Halloween. Hamilton King award-winning illustrator, James Bennett's outlandish illustrations perfectly depict these unique observations, reminding us why Jerry Seinfeld is still the funniest man alive.</p><p>If the only "really clear thought" you had as a kid was "Get candy," you'll be at one with comedian Jerry Seinfeld's first children's picture book, <i>Halloween</i>. This nostalgic view of Halloweens past will ring true with everyone who remembers the trials and tribulations of trick-or-treating--from the stupid masks with thin gray rubber straps and cheap little staples to the humiliation of having to wear a winter coat over your store-bought Superman costume. Of course, the smart-alecky Seinfeld puts his own stamp on things in a voice that is so distinctly his: "Come on lady, let's go! Halloween, doorbells, candy, let's pick it up in there." He wants "name candy" only, make no mistake, and even trick-or-treats with an organizational cabinet on wheels, with drawers labeled "Crunchy Things," "Sour Things," "Rejects," etc. James Bennett's exaggerated, hilarious, expressive illustrations of the young Jerry (yes, it looks <i>exactly</i> like him) suit the over-the-top story to a T. Unusual child's-eye perspectives on parents (and friends up the sidewalk who won't wait up) add energy to a book that is already sugar-charged. Like Jerry's standup routines, <i>Halloween</i> focuses on the minutiae and will make you laugh even if you try to resist.

In this BBC dramatization, the daily life of a training stable is vividly presented with nickering horses and the thundering sounds of hooves as horses run the track. The sickening sound of a collarbone being purposefully broken defies description. The audio dramatization gives this book the verisimilitude of a true story.

The Knipl stories collected here resurrect a lost metropolis and its residents, summoning up half-forgotten yesterdays and celebrating the surreal substrate of the quotidien.</p><p>Ben Katchor&#39;s dreamscape is peopled by transistor radio listeners, door-knob triers, false eyebrow importers, and a late-night-perambulating real estate photographer named Julius Knipl. The vaguely melancholy stories in his eight-panel comic strips reflect a fondness for the forgotten, the obscure, and the merely overlooked. What happens to the city&#39;s wholesale calendar salesmen in February? Who buys last year&#39;s tinned seedless grapes? Katchor&#39;s shadowed line drawings of a gray metropolis evoke musty smells, the shuffling steps of retirees, and a proliferating autumnal chill. Readers who enjoy his work in their local weekly papers, as well as NPR listeners who have been held captive by the &#34;Knipl Radio-Cartoons&#34; will be glad to linger a little longer in the dream life of Katchor&#39;s world.[A]fter years of peregrinating with Knipl in search of vanished places and forgotten dreams, I'm convinced that his creator, Ben Katchor, is the most poetic, deeply layered artist ever to draw a comic strip ... sort of a Max Beckman with dialogue balloons.... Mr. Katchor should take comfort and a great deal of pride in knowing that he has created perhaps the most original comic strip since ...

He was nurtured in the tradition of Anna Freud, John Rickman and D.W. Winnicott, but his contribution to psychoanalytic literature was a distinctive and personal one. What emerges from this book is the natural and private crystallization of his experiences with his patients and teachers.<br><br>As he says in his preface: "Psychoanalysis is an extremely private discipline of sensibility and skill. The practice of psychoanalysis multiplies this privacy into a specialized relationship between two persons, who through the very nature of their exclusivity with each other change each other. The first thing I wish to say about my work reported in these papers is that my patients have helped me become and personalize my potential of thought, affectivity and effort into a way of life that I find deeply satisfying. Had I followed another career perhaps my life would have been more dramatic and varied, but certainly not fuller. My relation with my patients has taught me the humility and necessity of the need of the other for one to be and become oneself."</p><p>Mohammed Masud Raza Khan (1924 - 1989) was an Pakistani British psychoanalyst. His training analyst was Donald Winnicott. Masud Raza Khan was a protege of Sigmund Freud&#39;s daughter Anna and a long-time collaborator with the most famous child analyst of the 20th century, D.W. Winnicott. Alongside clinical practice and teaching, he authored over 60 published papers, as well as numerous reviews, and edited significant portions of Winnicott&#39;s literary output and that of other key luminaries within the psychoanalytical canon. His key works include &#39;The Privacy of the Self&#39;, &#39;Alienation in Perversions&#39;, &#39;Hidden Selves&#39;, &#39;The Long Wait&#39; and &#39;When Spring Comes&#39;."Khan's erudition is of a very special kind.He puts his finger on the pulse of the dilemma, crisis or illness of our time, our wish and need to preserve our unique individual selves and our no less urgent wish and need for living in a community with others." (Paula Heimann <i>International Journal of Psycho-Analysis</i>)<br><br>"Masud Khan, a psychoanalyst who is renowned for both vivacity and learning....demonstrates his own ability to reach (those characters whom psychiatrists label 'schizoid') and provides a theoretical framework which will be of value to others engaged on the same quest."

A few winemakers who had held on through Prohibition and some newcomers, deemed eccentric by most, had great faith in the potential preeminence of Napa wines. They planted grapes unknown to the Valley--Chardonnay, Cabernet--and within 25 years, Napa wines had come to rival those of France and Italy. Former Washington Post reporter Conaway ( The Kingdom in the Country, LJ 10/15/87) carefully profiles Napa's visionaries, telling their personal stories and revealing the unlikely sources of their inspiration, some of it the stuff of fevered historical romance fiction. He also documents the 1970s invasion of tourism and the big liquor companies. His book is readable and authoritative, if somewhat exhausting.

In Asia, many historians rank him with such rulers as Augustus, Genghis Khan, and Napoleon. When he founded the Tang dynasty, Taizong was only twenty-eight years old, and his chief accomplishments were on the battlefield, where he personally slew 1,000 of the enemy. Ultimately, he would defeat the descendants of Attila the Hun, open up the Silk Road trading route, create a golden age of prosperity and cosmopolitan culture, preside over a society in which women enjoyed higher status, and allow Christianity and Islam into China for the first time as well as introduce Buddhism into Tibet. His dynasty would last 300 years.<br> <br>Here, author Chinghua Tang presents conversations between Taizong and his gifted advisers that reveal core aspects of leadership, among them: how to appraise oneself and assess others, how to enhance organizational effectiveness, how to compete with rivals, how to grow power and influence without losing the respect of others, how to learn from the rise and fall of predecessors, and how to craft one&#x2019;s legacy.<br> <br>An indispensable guide that is as relevant for a middle-manager, military commander, or athletic coach as for a school principal, political leader, or over-stressed parent, <i>The Ruler&#x2019;s Guide </i>doesn&#x2019;t just reveal the insights that have kept Taizong&#x2019;s legacy alive, it spells out how that wisdom is a match for today&#x2019;s fast-paced, ever changing world.</p><p>Chinghua Tang was born in Shanghai, where he&nbsp;studied at East China Normal University.

Considering evil from the unusual perspective of the perpetrator, Baumeister asks, How do ordinary people find themselves beating their wives? Murdering rival gang members? Torturing political prisoners? Betraying their colleagues to the secret police? Why do cycles of revenge so often escalate? <p>Baumeister casts new light on these issues as he examines the gap between the victim's viewpoint and that of the perpetrator, and also the roots of evil behavior, from egotism and revenge to idealism and sadism. A fascinating study of one of humankind's oldest problems, Evil has profound implications for the way we conduct our lives and govern our society.</p></p><p>Roy F. Baumeister, Ph.D., holds the E. B. Smith Professorship in Liberal Arts at Case Western Reserve University. Since receiving his doctorate in social psychology from Princeton University, he has received numerous fellowships and awards. He has published nearly 150 scientific works and is cited in numerous sources in the popular media. Baumeister has authored or co-authored nine other books, including <i>Losing Control: How and Why Self-Regulation Fails</i>, and <i>Meanings of Life</i>. He lives on the shores of the Great Lakes. <p>Dr. Aaron T. Beck, M.D., the Father of Cognitive Therapy, is University Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, and President of The Beck Institute for Cognitive Therapy. He is the author and co-author of twelve books and over 350 articles and chapters.</p>The question of why people hurt others is perhaps humanity&#39;s oldest and most urgent, long the subject of literature and religion. Can social science provide any answers? Social psychologist Baumeister assembles the available research, such as experiments on how people justify small transgressions and react to hypothetical situations, as well as close readings of accounts by murderers, rapists and torturers. He concludes that &#34;pure evil&#34;--brutality inflicted on innocent victims for sadistic pleasure--is largely a myth. Most violence springs from the same sources as other human behavior: ambition, lust, fear, pride, idealism. It breaks out when self-control breaks down, often because of group pressures or a slow escalation from seemingly innocuous decisions. Most perpetrators do not enjoy their acts, at least at first, but feel they must be done. &#34;To understand evil,&#34;Baumeister writes, &#34;we must set aside the comfortable belief that we would never do anything wrong. Instead, we must begin to ask ourselves, what would it take for me to do such things?&#34; Although few of these ideas are original to Baumeister, and the book is sometimes pedantic, it is a worthy synthesis both for victims who want to know why and for policymakers who need to know what to do.</p><h2>The World of the Microscope (Usborne Science &amp; Experiments) (Usborne Science &amp; Experiments)</h2><p>softcover</p><p></p><h2>Revolution from the Middle</h2><p>In &#39;Winning the Culture War&#39;, one of the most provocative and insightful essays in this collection, Samuel Francis argues that Middle Americans must adopt an insurgent, rather than a conservative strategy.

He's living (for now) with his spaced-out mother and little brother in a homeless shelter. His father's in jail. His girlfriend supports him, but he doesn't feel good enough for her - and seems to be always on the verge of doing the wrong thing around her. There's another girl at the homeless shelter who is also after him, although the desires there are complicated. Tyrell feels he needs to score some money to make things better. Will he end up following in his father's footsteps?</p><p>Coe Booth is a graduate of The New School&#x2019;s Writing for Children MFA program, and a winner of the L.A. Times Book Prize for Young Adult Fiction. She is the author of Tyrell and Kendra, and was born and still lives in the Bronx.<br>rkus<br>After his DJ father is incarcerated for drug dealing, 15-year-old Tyrell, his brother and his mother<br>are rendered homeless and move to a slummy city shelter in the Bronx. His mom's ineffectual attempts<br>at keeping the family afloat financially and emotionally soon fall flat, and Tyrell is forced to take the<br>family's situation into his own hands. Inspired by his father, he decides to throw a secret dance party<br>in an abandoned bus garage with a steep admission charge guaranteed to boost his family's income.<br>Booth, a writing consultant for the NYC Housing Authority, clearly understands how teens living on<br>the edge in shelters, in projects, on the street live, talk and survive. It's the slick street language of<br>these tough but lovable characters and her gritty landscapes that will capture the interests of urban<br>fiction fans. While the complex party-planning plotline doesn't exactly cut a straight path, its<br>convoluted-ness undoubtedly illustrates the kinds of obstacles these teens must overcome and the<br>connections they need to make in order to survive inside or outside the law. (Fiction. YA)<br>. . .<br><br>*STAR*Booklist<br> You don't hardly get to have no kinda childhood in the hood.&#x201d; At 15, Tyrell, is trying to keep his little brother in school and safe in their roach-infested shelter in the Bronx. He's dropped out of school, and Moms wants want him to sell weed to make money. But Tyrell is too smart. He doesn't want to end up in prison like his dad, so he tries to organize a neighborhood party to raise money. His girlfriend, Novisha, isn't happy that Tyrell has dropped out. She loves him, and they make out, but he respects her wish to remain a virgin. Booth, who was born and raised in the Bronx, is now a social worker there, and her first novel is heartbreakingly realistic. There are some plot contrivances including Tyrell's stumbling upon Novisha's diary but the immediate first-person narrative is pitch-perfect: fast, funny, and anguished (There's also lots of use of the n-word, though the term is employed in the colloquial sense, not as an insult). Unlike many books reflecting the contemporary street scene, this one is more than just a pat situation with a glib resolution; it's filled with surprising twists and turns that continue to the end.

But as Robert Bryce makes clear in this provocative book, that vision needs a major re-vision. We cannot and will not quit using carbon-based fuels at any time in the near future for a simple reason: they provide the horsepower that we crave. The hard reality is that oil, coal, and natural gas are here to stay.<p>Fueling our society requires more than sentiment and rhetoric; we need to make good decisions and smart investments based on facts. In <i>Power Hungry</i>, Bryce provides a supertanker-load of footnoted facts while shepherding readers through basic physics and math. And with the help of a panoply of vivid graphics and tables, he crushes a phalanx of energy myths, showing why renewables are not green, carbon capture and sequestration won't work, and even surprise! that the U.S. is leading the world in energy efficiency. He also charts the amazing growth of the fuels of the future: natural gas and nuclear.</p><p><i>Power Hungry</i> delivers a clear-eyed view of what America has in the tank,&#x201d; and what's needed to transform the gargantuan global energy sector.</p></p><p><b>Robert Bryce</b> has been producing industrial-strength journalism for two decades. His articles on energy and other subjects have appeared in dozens of publications ranging from the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> to <i>Counterpunch</i> and <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> to <i>Oklahoma Stripper</i>. He is the author most recently of <i>Gusher of Lies: The Dangerous Delusions of Energy Independence.&#x201d;</i> Bryce is also the managing editor of <i>Energy Tribune</i>. He lives in Austin.Journalist Bryce, author of Gusher of Lies and managing editor of online industry newsmagazine Energy Tribune, is nothing if not polemical. While his swings are sometimes familiar ("The essence of protecting the environment can be distilled to a single phrase: Small is beautiful") and sometimes bizarre ("The world isn't using too much oil. It's not using enough"), the points he raises merit serious consideration. In this informed, opinionated state-of-the-industry overview, Bryce contends that energy policy must be based upon four imperatives: "power density, energy density, cost and scale." Wind and solar power, he says, fail those standards due to storage problems and the vagaries of weather; Denmark, the poster child for renewable energy, nevertheless imports hydroelectric power from Norway and Sweden, relies heavily upon North Sea oil and coal, and increased its greenhouse gas emissions by 2.1 percent between 1990 and 2006. Pointing to the environmental cost of hydropower ("ruining habitats for aquatic life"), oil spills, and coal mining, Bryce makes a strong case for heavier reliance upon natural gas, a relatively clean and readily available carbon fuel, as a bridge technology: "The smartest, most forward-looking U.S. energy policy can be summed up in one acronym: 'N2N'," for "natural gas to nuclear power." <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Such changes are difficult to study, and harder still to prove. Carl Zimmer looks at metamorphoses across the boundary between land and sea: how fish learned to walk on land, and how whales went back to the ocean. "The story of each of these transformations hides its own unexpected details, as startling as the skyward eyes that sat on top of our ancestors' heads or the delicate toes that turned up in the equation of a whale." Zimmer's account is accurate yet lively, covering recent discoveries in taxonomy and dolphin intelligence, embryology and eight-toed fossil fish. <i>--Mary Ellen Curtin</i>Points to Zimmer, a senior editor at Discover magazine, for tackling unplowed ground in popular paleontology: no less than the movement of life from sea to land (over 350 million years ago) and the later reverse migration as land mammals returned to the sea. These transitions are dubbed ``macroevolution''--big changes, as opposed to the smaller changes of microevolution. The bare bones of current theory has it that we are descended from lobe-finned fishes. During a wet period when plants were creeping toward the water's edge and swamps abounded with life, these fish developed fins with fingers and toes to maneuver on muddy bottoms and pick at plant life while staying mainly in the water. But one thing led to another, and more land-lubbering species emerged. The one thing Zimmer emphasizes is the role of ``Hox'' genes, which control major events in embryogenesis, such as the shape of the basic body pattern and the formation of limbs from tissue ``buds.'' A mutation in timing or patterning of Hox genes can do wonders for changing form and function. The reverse transition from land to sea is an equally complex story and maybe even more controversial. It involves what Zimmer describes as a misfit group of hoofed, long-snouted, carnivorous predators called ``mesonychids'' drawn to the sea for the rich herring and other catches. Subsequent changes over a few million years involved loss of fur, hips, and lower limbs and development of fins and fluke and other essentials of life in the depths. Zimmer uses the latest cladistic diagrams to plot the species splits and changes over time--pointing out that they are at odds with molecular geneticists' DNA analyses, which would have hippos as whales' closest living relatives. Don't hold your breath waiting for resolution on that score. But do credit Zimmer with this scholarly disquisition on two of evolution's most absorbing transformations. -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Cattle bawling and milling around looked pretty damned real, too. And that little covered wagon, with a bald-headed man the size of a refrigerator sitting on the buckboard holding the reins for two horses in his hands, didn't have a single funny thing about it, either.</p> <p>Haley's mouth went dry when she realized that the big dapple-gray horse was for her and that absolutely nothing in front of her was a practical joke. It was all as real as the smell of the horses and what they'd dropped on the ground.</p> <p>She slung open the door of her little red sports car. The cowboys were all slack jawed, as if they'd never seen a woman before. Well, they'd best tie a rope around their chins and draw them back up because she was going to be their sidekick for the next thirty days. They could like it or hate it. It didn't really matter to her. All she wanted to do was get the month over with and go home to civilization.</p> <p>"You lose your way?" The cowboy on a big black horse looked down at her. His tone was icy and his deep green eyes even colder.</p> <p>"Not if this is the O'Donnell horse ranch and you're about to take off on the Chisholm Trail reenactment." She looked up into the dark-haired cowboy's green sexy eyes. "Who are you?" She planted her high heels on the ground and got out of the car.</p> <p>"Dewar O'Donnell, and you are?"</p> <p>Dammit! With a name like Dewar, she'd pictured a sixty-year-old man with a rim of graying hair circling an otherwise bald head, and a face wrinkled up like the earth after a hard summer, complete with a day's growth of gray whiskers. He sure wasn't supposed to look like Timothy Olyphant with Ben Bass's eyes. It was going to be one hell of a month because she wasn't about to get involved with a cowboy. Not even if she had the sudden urge to crawl right up on that horse and see if those eyes were as dreamy up close as they were from ten feet away.</p> <p>"I'm H. B. Mckay," she answered.</p> <p>"Well, shit!" Dewar drawled.</p> <p>"I know. Life's a bitch, isn't it? But I'll be riding along this whole trip taking notes for the reality show to be filmed this summer," she said. "Unless you want to tell me that this is a big silly joke and I can go home to Dallas now."</p> <p>"Can't do that, ma'am. I was expecting you to be a man, but we're ready to move this herd north so I guess you'd better saddle up. I was just about to call Carl Levy and ask where you were," Dewar drawled.</p> <p>"That's the idea most people have. I guess that empty horse is for me and I don't get to drive from point to point and stay in a hotel?"</p> <p>"That's the plan Carl made," he answered.</p> <p>She crossed her arms over her chest. "So we are ready to go right now?"</p> <p>"Unless you want to change clothes," he said.</p> <p>"Hell, no! I'm wearing what I've got on, and if I get a single snag in this suit Daddy will be paying for a brand new one," she said.</p> <p>Dewar frowned. "Daddy?"</p> <p>"Carl Levy is my father as well as my boss."</p> <p>***</p> <p>Dewar had always had a liking for redheads, but not the kind that wore high-heeled shoes and business suits. And it seemed like here lately he'd dated every redhead in the whole northern part of Texas. Because both of his brothers and his two sisters had beat him to the altar, now everyone in the family thought they had a PhD in matchmaking and had made it their life mission to get him married off.</p> <p>He'd rebelled at first, but then he admitted that he really wanted to have a wife and family so he'd started looking around on his own. He hadn't joined one of those online dating services, but he had been dating a lot. Either he was too damn picky or else all the good ones were taken because very few women interested him enough for a second date.</p> <p>H. B.'s eyes were a soft aqua, somewhere between blue and green like the still, deep waters of the ocean. And her lips full, the kind that begged for kisses. He felt a stirring down deep in his heart that he hadn't felt before, but he didn't know if it was anger or desire.</p> <p>It really didn't matter because the whole damn thing had to be a joke. It was too ridiculous to be real. Raylen had cooked it up and paid some woman to help him pull it off. He pulled his cell phone from his shirt pocket and quickly punched in the numbers to the office of the Dallas magazine tycoon.</p> <p>"Carl Levy, please."</p> <p>Ten long seconds later, "Tell him this is Dewar O'Donnell and this is definitely an emergency."</p> <p>H. B. shook her head and took her saddlebags from her car. "You are wasting your time, cowboy."</p> <p>Dewar hooked a leg over the saddle horn and ignored her. "Carl, I've got a red-haired woman who says she's H. B. McKay. You want to verify that?"</p> <p>He frowned.</p> <p>"You led me to believe that H. B. was a man, sir. A woman hasn't got any business on a cattle drive."</p> <p>H. B. yelled over the noise of bawling cattle, snorting horses, and laughing men. "Tell him Momma is going to throw a Cajun fit, and if he's smart he'll walk in the house with roses in one hand and an apology on his lips."</p> <p>"Yes, sir, that was her," Dewar said.</p> <p>She held out her hand. "Give me that phone."</p> <p>Dewar leaned down and put it in her hand.</p> <p>"You are going to pay for this, Daddy. I'm pissed off worse than I've ever been before in my life. I'm so pissed off that I'm not even going to talk to you about it and you can tell Joel that I know he's behind this shit and I'll get even with him when I get home."</p> <p>Everything went silent. Even the cows stopped bawling.</p> <p>"Stop laughing. I'll show you what I can do, but you are going to be sorry. Believe me, you are going to regret it."</p> <p>She handed the phone back to Dewar. "He says to tell you good luck. You ready?"</p> <p>He put the phone back in his pocket and nodded toward the dapple-gray horse. "Soon as you tie down those bags and mount up. Apache is spirited, but he's tough. You ever ridden?"</p> <p>"Once or twice," she answered.</p> <p>***</p> <p>She still couldn't believe that she was going on a Chisholm Trail cattle run. There was no doubt that she'd aggravated her father big-time when she'd broken her engagement six months before, but she thought he'd gotten over it.</p> <p>"Evidently I was dead wrong," she mumbled.</p> <p>Joel was a hardworking businessman in her father's corporation, but when it came down to brass tacks, she hadn't loved the man nearly as much as her father had liked him for a potential new son-in-law. When she called off the engagement, Carl Levy sure hadn't been happy with her. Well, she damn sure wasn't happy with him today, so maybe that made them even.</p> <p>Even though she wasn't marrying Joel, Carl had kept him as his right-hand man and she was sure that Joel was behind the whole idea of sending her off into the wilds on horseback, for God's sake. Well, she'd prove to both her dad and her former fianc� that she could handle the job better than either of them.</p> <p>Cowboys were wonderful subjects to film. Women loved their tight-fitting jeans, boots, belt buckles, and slow drawls. But they sure weren't her cup of tea. No sir! Give her a man in a custom-fit three-piece suit any day of the week over a man who liked horses and cows better than five-star restaurants and Broadway plays. So that tall, dark cowboy with a black hat pulled down over his eyes had better lay low for at least a week. She might begin to cool off by then.</p> <p>It was going to be a long month with no cell phone or even a laptop. She had to take notes by hand and give them to the cook who would send them by snail mail whenever he went for supplies.</p> <p>Thank goodness she knew how to tie down a saddlebag, even if she did have to tiptoe to get the job done. Not a single one of those cowboys hopped down off their horses and offered to do it for her, proving that she was right in her choice of men. Cowboys were only gentlemen in movies and romance books. The real thing didn't even exist. When they dropped their britches and kicked off their boots, they were just like all other men. And she didn't have time for any of them.</p> <p>She stuck her high-heeled shoe in the stirrup, grabbed the saddle horn, and gave a little bounce. The slick red bottom of her spike-heeled shoe slipped in the stirrup. The foot on the ground was standing in a fresh pile of horse manure. The momentum jerked her hand off the saddle horn and she was staring with wide open eyes at big fluffy white clouds somewhere past the horses, cowboys, and even the big pecan trees. Her chest felt like it was going to explode when she finally remembered to force air into her lungs, and the smell of fresh warm horse shit hit her nose.</p> <p>She quickly pulled herself up into a sitting position. Her shoes were ruined. Her best power suit was a mess. And she hadn't even gotten on that horse yet. Her father had better get busy fulfilling all the things on his bucket list.</p> <p>She looked up to see a hand extended toward her and she took it. A different cowboy heaved her up to her feet. He looked somewhat like Dewar, but he wasn't as tall, but then Dewar was sitting on the biggest horse she'd ever seen, so maybe he just looked like he was ten feet tall and bulletproof.</p> <p>"Thank you," she said.</p> <p>"Guess you didn't get a good hold on that stirrup with those shoes," he said. "I'm Raylen. Who are you?"</p> <p>"Had nothing to do with my ability to mount the horse. I stepped in horse shit! I'm H. B. McKay," she said through clenched teeth.</p> <p>Raylen chuckled and then roared. He wiped his eyes with the back of his hand. "I can't wait to tell Liz. Dewar, you are never living this one down."</p> <p>"Who is Liz?" Haley asked.</p> <p>If Liz was Dewar's wife or girlfriend, that just complicated matters even more. No woman would want her husband or boyfriend out in the wilds for a whole month with a strange woman.</p> <p>Raylen didn't answer but pointed at her. "You are the sissified fellow my brother has been bitchin' about for two months? Now that is rich."</p> <p>"Sissified!" Haley cut her eyes up at Dewar and set her mouth in a hard line.</p> <p>Dewar shrugged. "How can Carl Levy be your father and your name be McKay?"</p> <p>"My name is Haley McKay Levy. I dropped the last name for professional reasons. No one needs to know that Carl is my father," she said.</p> <p>"What's the B stand for?" he asked.</p> <p>"Bitch! And don't you forget it," she told him.</p> <p>"You sure you don't want five minutes to change into some boots? You did bring something other than those shoes, I hope, or maybe you're planning to ride all day in your bare feet?" Dewar drawled. "I'll give you ten minutes to change. If you aren't ready to ride by then, we're leaving you behind and you can scoot right back to Daddy and tell him to send us a man who can do the job."</p> <p>"I've got boots and jeans," she said from behind clenched teeth.</p> <p>Did all men share DNA with jackasses, or was it just because it was April Fools' Day?</p> <p>Dewar pointed toward a barn.</p> <p>She untied her saddlebags and stomped off in that direction. She hadn't been on a horse since she was in college. She'd taken a riding class as an elective, but that had been eight years before. She hadn't liked anything about horses then, not the way they smelled, brushing them, or the crap they left behind. According to her professor, it was therapeutic. According to Haley, it was a big waste of her time.</p> <p>But in the next thirty days she'd prove to the whole damn bunch of them that she wasn't a sissified anything. And when she got back home to Dallas, Joel had best pack his bags and catch the next flight back to Holly-damn-wood.</p> <p>She'd carefully packed the saddlebags with the pair of Roper boots that she'd bought for the riding class, three pairs of jeans, four T-shirts, and clean underwear and socks plus a thick spiral notebook and several ballpoint pens. She'd gotten ready, but she still could hardly believe it was happening. She'd even prepared a speech giving her father credit for the biggest and best prank ever. Her mother had assured her every day the past week that it wasn't real, and Haley had believed her right up until she saw all those cowboys, horses, and the wagon. Wait until her mother found out that her father sent her and not Joel.</p> <p>"I really, really wouldn't want to be Daddy tonight," she mumbled.</p> <p>She found an empty horse stall in the barn and kicked off her smelly shoes, removed her slacks, jacket, and blouse. She jerked on jeans and a T-shirt and pulled socks from inside her boots. She cussed under her breath the whole time she put them on and shoved her feet down into the Ropers. That blasted riding class turned out to be her biggest mistake in her college years. She'd gotten a B in it-the only one on her transcript. But she was glad she'd saved the boots.</p> <p>"Hey, where are you?" a woman's voice yelled.</p> <p>"I'm back here in a stall," Haley said.</p> <p>The voice came closer. "You are the reality television person?"</p> <p>Haley hung her clothes on the stall door. They were ruined for sure and those shoes had only been worn once. The smell of horse crap would never come out of the leather.</p> <p>"Yes, I am."</p> <p>"Decent yet?"</p> <p>Haley opened the stall door. "I hope I am."</p> <p>She faced a short dark-haired woman wearing faded jeans and a pearl-snap chambray work shirt and a denim jacket.</p> <p>"And you are?" Haley asked.</p> <p>"I'm Liz O'Donnell, Dewar's sister-in-law, and you'd be the fellow who is going along to take notes for that reality show?" Liz laughed.</p> <p>"Guess I surprised them all." Haley smiled.</p> <p>"Dewar still thinks it's a joke that Raylen has pulled on him. I'd love to be a fly on the tree bark when he figures out this whole thing is real and my husband did not play an April Fools' joke on him," Liz said.</p> <p>"I'd love to be a fly on the dining room table tonight when my momma figures out that Daddy sent me on this trip. There might not even be a Dallas after tonight," Haley said.</p> <p>Liz pulled off her denim jacket and handed it to Haley. "Put this on.

It was Gorbachev's initiative that raised the Iron Curtain; his actions that resulted in one of the era's most symbolic events, the demolition on the Berlin Wall; his reforms that set in train events leading to the fall of Communism.</p><p> Twelve years ago, when Gorbachev came to power, the globe was still divided into two armed camps, one for each superpower - as it had been ever since 1945. The Cold War dominated international politics, from Angola to Afghanistan. The man who became leader of the Soviet Union in 1985 was much younger than his predecessors, yet there was little else to distinguish him from the stony-faced apparatchiks waving from the Kremlin. He seemed a model Communist, ideologically committed to socialism, raised wholly within the confines of the Party. Yet Gorbachev realized that the system could not continue. What was it about this man which enabled him to see so much more clearly than his colleagues?</p><p> Like most who start a revolution, Gorbachev has been left behind. No longer in power, he has been forced to endure criticism from those wise after the event - most notably Boris Yeltsin, who became undisputed leader after the failed military coup that finally displaced Gorbachev from office. In these memoirs Gorbachev reveals his feelings about the sad state of his country today. He tells us of his childhood in the North Caucasus during the Second World War, of coming to Moscow as a student and meeting Raisa Maksimovna, of his glittering career as a Party functionary, eventually becoming one of the most powerful men in the world. This is a historical document of the first importance. It is also a fascinating human story, an insider's account of the events that we never dared believe could happen.</p></p><p>The memoirs of Mikhail Gorbachev, one of the greatest world leaders of the twentieth century.<p>Mikhail Gorbachev is the man who changed everything.

In this latest story little attention is paid to the art of crime detection. No one cares about a couple of bodies in the woods. The real story is about opening a new bookstore, planning for a bicentennial, chasing wild turkeys, and producing a play about a devastating storm of 1913. What keeps the series popular are the local characters, the cats, and protagonist Quill, who is lively, wise, and funny. George Guidall does his usual superb job of bringing alive Quill, the good citizens of Mooseville, and even the cats. (His portrayal of Koko's yowls is worth listening for.)

Brown is at his best when he writes of the tensions between one screwed-up man and another, in this case a father and son. One has just been let out of prison, and he shouldn&#39;t have been. The other is drunk and disabled and intends on staying that way. To make things worse, there is a conflict with the sheriff, who is good and righteous but who tried to put the moves on the parolee&#39;s woman while he was in prison. To tell more would be to violate Brown&#39;s mastery of dialogue and of that which goes unspoken in this sly story of father, son, and misery.<b>Larry Brown</b> was born in Lafayette County, Mississippi, where he lived all his life. At the age of thirty, a captain in the Oxford Fire Department, he decided to become a writer and worked toward that goal for seven years before publishing his first book, <i>Facing the Music</i>, a collection of stories, in 1988. With the publication of his first novel, <i>Dirty Work</i>, he quit the fire station in order to write full time. (The nonfiction book&nbsp;<i>On Fire</i> tells the story of his many years as a firefighter.) Between then and his untimely death in 2004, he published seven more books.&nbsp;He was awarded the Mississippi Institute of Arts and Letters award for fiction and&nbsp;was the first two-time winner of the Southern Book Award for Fiction, which he won in 1992 for&nbsp;<i>Joe,&nbsp;</i>and again in 1997 for <i>Father and Son</i>.

Although these media adopt the general approach to profiling, artistic license skews public perception of this meticulous process. In reality, profiling came into its own as a well-respected area of analysis after many painstaking reviews of unusually violent crime cases. Law enforcement agencies use criminal investigative analysis to identify and apprehend violent and often serial offenders by spotting vital suspect and crime scene characteristics, patterns of behavior and activity that help investigators anticipate the criminal's next step or spot likely victims. Although the terms used have evolved over the years, the process has not. <p>In PROFILERS, editors John H. Campbell and Don DeNevi offer a compelling selection of accounts that clarifies criminal investigative analysis, offering thorough reviews of cases and in-depth explanations of methodologies. These articles - by top homicide profilers in the FBI and other law enforcement agencies - bring together for the first time an informative yet riveting mix of styles and approaches to criminal profiling. </p><p>The first few chapters provide a much-needed historical perspective on profiling, focusing on the nuts and bolts f the process and using these tools in solving crimes involving, for example, mutilated victims of sexual murderers. In a fascinating probe into the mind of the rarest of criminals - the cannibal - Robert K. Ressler offers his interview with serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer. One chapter reviews in detail bizarre cases of autoerotic fatalities, and another chapter is an early examination of psychological profiling. </p><p>The remainder of this spine-tingling work centers on more contemporary uses of criminal profiling, including how forensic linguistics helped to capture the Unabomber, James R. Fitzgerald explains in detail how his unique efforts at the new science of linguistics analysis helped identify the mysterious bomber - efforts previously unused in criminal investigation. In chapter 17, Michael R. King stresses the need for cooperation among law enforcement officials in solving cold cases. To illustrate his point, King depicts in fine detail the murderers he has interviewed, including one who killed his sister-in-law and her daughter because he thought God told him to do so. Other chilling chapters profile those who rape and murder elderly women, those who abduct and kill children, those who gouge out their victims' eyes, and those who murder by fire. </p><p>This one-of-a-kind, enthralling compilation is a must-read for all who are amazed by or even just a bit curious about how psychology, behavioral science, and careful crime scene analysis converge to help capture serial criminals - before they claim their next victims.</p><b>John H.

Here a harried Lucy is trying to juggle children, husband and a full-time job when her best friend, Sue Finch, asks for help in planning the wedding of Sue's mother, Sidra, and Internet millionaire Ron Davitz. Lucy agrees to let the ceremony take place in her backyard gazebo. When the groom and his social-climbing mother arrive on a large yacht, tempers start flaring among the townspeople. Local fishermen are being displaced from their moorings in the harbor to make way for summer visitors in an attempt to raise much-needed revenues for the town. Davitz proves to be a singularly graceless, stereotypical computer nerd, but when he's found floating dead in the water, suspicion quickly focuses on an old flame of the bride. Lucy once more finds herself in the middle of a murder investigation, and at first she fears that Sue, or Sue's temperamental husband, might have done something drastic to get rid of a potential father-in-law he despised. In a leisurely paced investigation, Lucy perseveres through various irritations to dig up the truth. Despite the obvious pall cast by the murder of the groom, Meier manages to pull off a happy ending, replete with a charming wedding in which her fans will rejoice. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p>On a summer morning, reporter Lucy Stone learns that her friend Sue's daughter will marry a dot-com millionaire at Sue's Maine home. Then the prospective in-laws appear and try to take over the wedding, the groom drowns, and Sue finds herself the leading suspect. Lucy rushes to the rescue. In this eighth Lucy Stone mystery, Meier takes well-worn plot elements-- small-town tensions, in-law troubles--and buffs them into a fresh yarn. Characters and their interactions are realistic and dryly humorous, the Maine coast provides an evocative backdrop, and the short course on dot-com business is enlightening on its own and seamlessly incorporated into the story.

This timeless phrases succinctly captures what has happened to the majority of African Americans since the 1970s. The civil rights movement of the 1960s brought about remarkable gains for most black people, and by 1970 African Americans were beginning to be key figures in national politics and in corporate board rooms. The black middle class was decidedly growing, and thus a handful of African Americans escaped the frying pan altogether. But after 1970, heavy industry began to disappear as American companies looked to foreign lands for cheaper manufacturing. Millions of jobs were lost. The number of black poor began to grow dramatically, city services declined, federal spending on cities dried up, affirmative action programs were dismantled, blatant acts of racism began to rise again, and the United States entered a deep economic recession.<br> But this decline is only part of the story. Since 1970, the black community has resisted oppression, struggled for power, dealt with internal tensions and conflicts, and profoundly shaped American culture. This book explores a range of issues that the African American community faces in the late 20th century: the rebirth of black nationalism, the emergence of a new black conservative movement, the challenge of black feminism, the impact of Caribbean immigration, the rise of rap music and hip-hop culture. It looks at the impact on African American life of such diverse personalities as Roy Innis, Toni Morrison, Anita Hill, Jimi Hendrix, Louis Farrakhan, Angela Davis, Spike Lee, Barbara Jordan, Shirley Chisholm, and Jesse Jackson, among others. <em>Into the Fire</em> will challenge and be challenged by readers of all ages, and calls on our young people to exercise their power to determine the outcome of chapters yet to be written in the history of African Americans.<br></p><p><br><strong>Robin D.

Black-and-white period photographs, posters, prints, letters, and other artwork lend emphasis to salient points made in the texts. Both books include a useful chronology and extensive lists for further reading; additionally, Frankel appends the civil rights amendments to the U.S. Constitution.

That collaboration would mark the dawn of modern science . . . and end in murder.<br><br>Johannes Kepler changed forever our understanding of the universe with his three laws of planetary motion. He demolished the ancient model of planets moving in circular orbits and laid the foundation for the universal law of gravitation, setting physics on the course of revelation it follows to this day. Kepler was one of the greatest astronomers of all time. Yet if it hadn't been for the now lesser-known Tycho Brahe, the man for whom Kepler apprenticed, Kepler would be a mere footnote in today's science books. Brahe was the Imperial Mathematician at the court of the Holy Roman Emperor in Prague and the most famous astronomer of his era. He was one of the first great systematic empirical scientists and one of the earliest founders of the modern scientific method. His forty years of planetary observations&#x2014;an unparalleled treasure of empirical data&#x2014;contained the key to Kepler's historic breakthrough. But those observations would become available to Kepler only after Brahe's death. This groundbreaking history portrays the turbulent collaboration between these two astronomers at the turn of the seventeenth century and their shattering discoveries that would mark the transition from medieval to modern science. <br><br>But that is only half the story. Based on recent forensic evidence (analyzed here for the first time) and original research into medieval and Renaissance alchemy&#x2014;all buttressed by in-depth interviews with leading historians, scientists, and medical specialists&#x2014;the authors have put together shocking and compelling evidence that Tycho Brahe did not die of natural causes, as has been believed for four hundred years. He was systematically poisoned&#x2014;most likely by his assistant, Johannes Kepler. <br><br>An epic tale of murder and scientific discovery, <i>Heavenly Intrigue</i> reveals the dark side of one of history&#x2019;s most brilliant minds and tells the story of court politics, personal intrigue, and superstition that surrounded the protean invention of two great astronomers and their quest to find truth and beauty in the heavens above.</p></p><p>Johannes Kepler's laws of planetary motion rank among science's biggest ideas. But did Kepler lie, steal, or even murder for the data he needed to complete his revolutionary calculations? Joshua and Anne-Lee Gilder make this bold claim in <i>Heavenly Intrigue</i>, the story of Kepler's troubled relationship with Tycho Brahe. The astronomers are shown as polar opposites--Kepler the anguished, poor misanthrope and Brahe the blustering young noble on intimate terms with King Frederick II. Since the authors tip their hand early in the book, it's easy to mistake the two men's lives as predestined, their sad fates written in the stars. Kepler, the suspect, is revealed to be consumed with a "constant boiling anger" and beset by illness and unhealed sores. When Kepler and Brahe meet, it is under a dark cloud of misunderstanding that foreshadows later conflicts. Each genius offends the other, publicly and privately: Brahe, holding the money and power, makes Kepler do tedious calculations rather than sponsoring original research, while Kepler demands patronage and lusts after valuable data. When the story is done, the narrative moves quickly to the 20th century. The apocryphal tale of Brahe's demise by burst bladder is systematically countered by researchers who find toxic levels of mercury in hairs from what is presumed to be Brahe's corpse. Did Kepler, who had means, motive, and opportunity, poison Brahe? Readers will either be convinced by the end of the prologue or have lingering doubts about the case's holes that even the authors' certainty can't patch. <i>--Therese Littleton</i><p><b>Joshua Gilder</b> has worked as a magazine editor, White House speechwriter, and State Department official and is the author, most recently, of the novel <i>Ghost Image</i>. <b>Anne-Lee Gilder</b> was formerly a producer and investigative reporter for German television.

The 39 tales, including Murder Me for Nickels , Peter Rabe's 1960 novella about jukebox racketeers, are a pleasing mix of new offerings and classics from the pulp magazines of the '50s and '60s. Ray Bradbury's "The Candy Skull" is a chilling lover's rivalry set against Mexico's Day of Death celebration. Mickey Spillane's heartfelt "The Affair with the Dragon Lady," on aging men trying to preserve their youth, combines emotive and criminal elements wonderfully. The resourceful Gorman succeeds in providing a surfeit of surprises in an overall delightful collection, although a few lesser pieces might have been excluded, such as "A Dreadful Lemon Pie," Timothy P.

The Ultimate Spot the Difference Book</h2><p>Invites the reader to find the differences between pictures that are similar but not identical</p><p>Grade 3-5-- A complex exotica of animal life presented as a wordless concept book. Facing pages show similar bustling scenes demonstrating both an abstract concept and a particular habitat ("Twilight sound/ The mountain scrub of Australasia"; "Under the eagle's eye/ The foothills of the Rocky Mountains"). Readers are asked to notice 12 "vital differences" in the two pictures, and the answers are revealed in a small coded guide that names and briefly describes the animals. Each of the illustrated pages features a center panel surrounded by smaller border segments; individually these have a rich appearance, but placed in pairs they are overwhelming in their busyness. Wilson realistically depicts the animals, but an unpleasing amount of orange in her palette gives a garish quality to many of her pictures. An overabundance of imagery and esoteric ideas are attempted, and many children will need assistance to get the hang of the guessing game. --Margaret Bush, Simmons College, Boston<br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.Facing pages of each spread contain views of nature that, at first glance, appear to be identical. Closer examination reveals that in fact a number of subtle changes--12 in each pairing--have occurred from one illustration to the other. A wax plant flowers, a python wraps around its prey, a chameleon changes color--all within exotic scenes whose venues range from tropical rain forest to northern tundra to deepest ocean. Wilson's paintings are highly realistic, lush in color and composition, and painstaking in detail. Reminiscent of Graeme Base's meticulous depictions of animals and animal characters, they demand--and repay--an intensity of viewing akin to that required by Base's The Eleventh Hour. The differences in each picture are indicated at the end of the book, where the appended nature notes contain a wealth of information about the natural world.

On the way to showing how the world of our ancient ancestors shaped our modern modular mind, Steven Mithen shares one provocative insight after another as he answers a series of fascinating questions: <ul><li>Were our brains hard-wired in the Pleistocene Era by the needs of hunter-gatherers?</li><li>&nbsp;When did religious beliefs first emerge?</li><li>Why were the first paintings made by humankind so technically accomplished and expressive?</li><li>What can the sexual habits of chimpanzees tell us about the prehistory of the modern mind?</li></ul> This is the first archaeological account to support the new modular concept of the mind. The concept, promulgated by cognitive and evolutionary psychologists, views the mind as a collection of specialized intelligences or "cognitive domains," somewhat like a Swiss army knife with its specialized blades and tools. Arguing that only archaeology can answer many of the key questions raised by the new concept, Mithen delineates a three-phase sequence for the mind's evolution over six million years&#x2015;from early Homo in Africa to the ice-age Neanderthals to our modern modular minds. <em>The Prehistory of the Mind</em> is an intriguing and challenging explanation of what it means to be human, a bold new theory about the origins and nature of the mind.<br> 70 illustrations</p><p>Try an experiment: take a passenger along on a brief car trip--a jaunt to the supermarket, say. Have a nice conversation while you're driving, and take a scenic route. Now, the next day, try to reconstruct the details of both the conversation and the trip. Chances are, unless something unusual happened along the way, that your memory of both will be indistinct, for we tend to forget the mundane--an example of what the cognitive scientist Daniel Dennett calls "rolling consciousness with swift memory loss."<p> Steven Mithen, an archaeologist with an interest in psychology, believes that just such a consciousness obtained among early humans when they went foraging for food or made tools. The evolution of higher, more memory-laden consciousness, he continues, occurred only as a result of a cognitive trick that doubtless involved some trial and error. The trick, simply put, was to guess what the social behavior of some member of one's social group might be in a given circumstance--to step outside one's own mind, in other words, and enter another's. This guesswork underlies the famed cave paintings of Altamira, an attempt to predict the behavior of migratory animals. It underlies as well another experiment: the development of agriculture, with the requisite predicting of how plants and animals might behave under a wide range of conditions.</p><p> Mithen's reconstruction of the ancestral human mind, laid out in a clear and accessible narrative, is a fine intellectual adventure. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Steven Mithen is a Professor of Archaeology at the University of Reading.

Ten years later, Mr. Duffy has produced a new book with a deceptively simple premise: a young boy copes with the loss of his mother during the tumultuous civil rights era. In a lesser writer's hands, <i>Last Comes the Egg</i> might have been just another coming-of-age novel, but Mr. Duffy takes the ordinary and makes something uncommon out of it. After his mother's death, 12-year-old protagonist Frank Dougherty takes off in a stolen car with two companions: Alvy, a tragically damaged altar boy; and Sheppy, an older African American boy with his own set of problems. <p> Duffy displayed fearlessness in tackling Wittgenstein in his first novel; he puts it to the test again by confronting race issues here. Throughout <i>Last Comes the Egg</i> the prose soars, the characters fascinate, and the journey is both harrowing and riveting.</p>The expectations raised by Duffy's astonishingly witty and entertaining first novel, The World As I Found It, which was based on the lives of philosophers Ludwig Wittgenstein, Bertrand Russell and G.E. Moore, are soundly met in his second. As a coming-of-age story (set in the early 1960s), the new novel is more mundane in concept than its predecessor; but Duffy's raw, off-center observations and syncopated prose cut new paths through well-trod territory. When Julie Dougherty takes ill and dies at age 38, her adolescent son, Frank, who narrates, and his father spin into separate, mad orbits in Corregidor, Md., a suburb of Washington, D.C. Frank's father, the self-proclaimed Mr. Fixit of the neighborhood, soon begins dating Heidi, a younger, take-charge blonde who flirtatiously wrestles and cuddles with Frank. At the first opportunity, Frank turns his back on this family drama by taking up with Alvy Loomis, a teenager with a large, unruly family and a knack for plotting reckless, violent capers. Alvy, who's convinced that his sister Charlene is in fact his mother, steals a car and leads Frank and Sheppy, a motherless black kid, on a road trip through the American South to find and confront Charlene. During the journey, Frank comes to fear Alvy. Yet he realizes that, just as the laws of thermodynamics dictate that there's always "heat in cold," so is there always "love in hate." He sees that he can't hate Alvy or his own father without loving them, too. Against the backdrop of racial turmoil, soaking up the pop-cultural language and beat of the 1960s, Frank struggles to understand his childhood, his family and his motherless and bewildered friends. Duffy demonstrates the magic of seeing, showing how a vision of truth can turn misery into humor and pain into poetry. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Perfect Rigor: A Genius and the Mathematical Breakthrough of the Century</h2><p><p><b>A gripping and tragic tale that sheds rare light on the unique burden of genius</b> </p><p>�&nbsp; </p><p>In 2006, an eccentric Russian mathematician named Grigori Perelman solved the Poincare Conjecture, an extremely complex topological problem that had eluded the best minds for over a century.

The Poincare conjecture is an extremely complex topological problem that had eluded the best minds for over a century. In 1998, the Clay Institute in Boston named it one of seven great unsolved mathematical problems, and promised a million dollars to anyone who could find a solution. Perelman will likely be awarded the prize this fall, and he will likely decline it. Fascinated by his story, journalist Masha Gessen was determined to find out why. <p></p> Drawing on interviews with Perelman's teachers, classmates, coaches, teammates, and colleagues in Russia and the US--and informed by her own background as a math whiz raised in Russia--she set out to uncover the nature of Perelman's genius. What she found was a mind of unrivalled computational power, one that enabled Perelman to pursue mathematical concepts to their logical (sometimes distant) end. But she also discovered that this very strength has turned out to be his undoing: such a mind is unable to cope with the messy reality of human affairs. When the jealousies, rivalries, and passions of life intruded on his Platonic ideal, Perelman began to withdraw--first from the world of mathematics and then, increasingly, from the world in general. In telling his story, Masha Gessen has constructed a gripping and tragic tale that sheds rare light on the unique burden of genius.<br> <br> <br> <p><b>A Q&amp;A with Masha Gessen, Author of <i>Perfect Rigor: A Genius and the Mathematical Breakthrough of the Century</i></b><br> </p><p></p> <b>Q:</b> Grigory Perelman doesn't talk to journalists. How did you write this book?<p></p> <b>A:</b> Actually, at this point he really talks to no one. When I first started researching the book, he was still speaking to his lifelong math tutor, his competition coach and, in many ways, the architect of his life, Sergei Rukshin. But sometime in the last couple of years, Perelman stopped talking to him. As far as I know, the only person with whom he is in permanent contact is his mother, with whom he shares an apartment on the outskirts of St. Petersburg.<p></p> Fortunately, while I had no access to Perelman, I talked to virtually all the people who had been important in his life: Rukshin, his classmates, his math-club mates, his high school math teacher, his competition coaches and teammates, his university thesis adviser, his graduate school adviser, his coauthors, and those who surrounded him in his postdoc years in the United States. In some ways, I think, these people were more motivated to speak with me because Perelman himself wasn't doing it--and because they felt his story had been misinterpreted in so many ways in the media.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> So not being able to talk to him was an advantage?<p></p> <b>A:</b> Funny as that sounds, in some ways, yes. When you write a biography of a cooperating subject--even if it is just a magazine story, never mind a book--you are in constant negotiation with that person's view of himself. And people tend to be terrible judges of themselves. So you are always balancing your own perceptions against the subject's aspirations, and this can actually get painful for all involved. All I had was research material and my own perceptions. In this sense, this was more like writing a novel: I was constructing this character.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> What made you think you could do this?<p></p> <b>A:</b> Actually, I made two erroneous assumptions. I assumed that the journalists who initially wrote about Perelman, around the time when he turned down the Fields Medal, mathematics' highest honor, were wrong. I assumed he was not as crazy, or as weird, as they made him sound. I figured he was a familiar type of Russian scientist--entirely devoted to his field, not at all attuned to social niceties and bureaucratic customs, and given to behaviors that can easily be misinterpreted, especially by foreign journalists. My second assumption, related to the first, was that my background as a Russian math school kid gave me the tools necessary to describe this type. My background certainly helped--I am Perelman's age, I come from the same kind of family, socially, economically, and educationally, as he does (Russian Jewish engineers with two children living on the outskirts of Leningrad in his case and Moscow in mine)--but it was barely a start. Because Perelman turned out to be much stranger than I assumed.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> So he is as crazy as they say?<p></p> <b>A:</b> I think <i>crazy</i> generally means that a person has an internally consistent view of the world that is entirely different from the view most people consider normal. I think this is true of Perelman. The interesting thing, of course, was to figure out what this internally consistent view of the world was.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> And did you manage to figure it out?<p></p> <b>A:</b> I think so. I concluded that this view, and the rigidity with which he holds to it, is actually directly related to the reason he was able to solve the hardest mathematical problem ever solved. He has a mind that is capable of taking in more information, and embracing more-complex systems, than any mind that has come before. His mind is like a universal math compactor. He grasps hugely complex problems and reduces them to their solvable essence. The problem is, he expects the world of humans to be similarly subject to reduction. He expects the world to function in accordance with a set of strictly laid out rules, and he absolutely cannot take in anything that does not conform to those rules. The world of humans is unruly, though, so Perelman has had to cut off successive chunks of it until all that was left was the apartment he shares with his mother.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> Is that quality of his mind what the title of the book refers to?<p></p> <b>A:</b> Yes, it's that "perfect rigor". But in fact that phrase comes from a quote by Henri Poincare, he of the Poincare Conjecture fame--from his ruminations on the nature of mathematical proof, which I quote in the middle of the book.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> So what is the Poincare Conjecture?<p></p> <b>A:</b> It is no more, actually. Now that Perelman has proved it, it is a theorem. And it is a classic theorem of topology, one of the most wonderfully weird mathematical disciplines. Topology, to my mind, is something like the perfect mathematical discipline. It leaves nothing to reality: though it deals with shape, you never measure objects in topology--not with a ruler, anyway. Rather, the concepts of topology are the products of their verbal definitions. And much of topology is concerned with things that are essentially the same as other things, even if at particular moments in time they happen to look different. For example, if you have a blob that can be reshaped into a sphere, then the sphere and the blob are essentially similar, or homeomorphic, as topologists say. So Poincare asked, in essence, whether all three-dimensional blobs that were not twisted and had no holes in them were homeomorphic to a three-dimensional sphere. And it took more than a hundred years to prove that yes, they were.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> So? What's the use of something so abstract?<p></p> <b>A:</b> Mathematicians hate that question. Mathematics is not here to be useful. It is beautiful, and that's enough. But the fact is, such discoveries generally have far-reaching--useful--consequences that are rarely evident at the moment of the breakthrough. The Poincare Theory will almost certainly have profound consequences for our understanding of space--the universe that we inhabit.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> And Perelman will be awarded a million dollars for this proof?<p></p> <b>A:</b> Probably. And he will probably turn it down. The commercialization of mathematics offends him. He was deeply hurt by the many generous offers he received from U.S. universities after he published his proof. He apparently felt he had made a contribution that was far greater than any amount of money--and rather than express their appreciation in appropriately mathematical ways, by studying his proof and working to understand it (he estimated correctly that it would take specialists about a year and a half to understand the proof), they were trying to take a shortcut and basically pay him off. By the same token, the million dollars will probably offend him.<p></p> At the same time, if he chose to accept the money, he would find a way to make that consistent with his system of rules and values. But I really don't think this is likely.<p></p> <p>(Photo � Vladimir Shirokov)</p> <br> <br><b>MASHA GESSEN</b> has written for <i>Slate, </i>the <i>New Republic,</i> <i>Vanity Fair</i>, the <i>New York Times,</i> and other publications.

Her name is on everyone's lips -- but can she help it if she was born rich and privileged? Now, with a sly sense of humor and a big wink at her media image, Paris lets you in for a sneak peek at the life of a real, live heiress/model/actress/singer/it-girl and tells you how anyone can live a fairy-tale life like hers.<p><i>"If you follow your own plans and dreams and you don't let anyone talk you out of them, then you'll start to get the hang of being an heiress....All you need after that is a good handbag, a great pose, and very high heels, and you're on your way. (Long blond hair doesn't hurt, either.)"</i></p><p>In her fabulous and very tongue-in-cheek -- and chic -- guide, you'll discover Paris's twenty-three rules for How to Be an Heiress (Never have only one cell phone when you can have many), Paris's list of Twelve Things an Heiress Would Never Do (Go out the night after the Oscars), and Three Things Most People Think Heiresses Shouldn't Do, But I Think They Should (Go out with broke guys). Paris also shares private information such as her memories of growing up with her sister, Nicky, and family photos; her favorite designers and her unique beauty secrets; what a night out with Paris is like; her personal gallery of fashion don'ts; and behind-the-scenes stories from both installments of her hit television series, <i>The Simple Life.</i> Of course no book by Paris would be complete without her pet teacup Chihuahua, Tinkerbell, and in these pages, the best-dressed dog in the world shares pages from her own secret diary.</p><p>Featuring more than three hundred fabulous color photos of Paris, <i>Confessions of an Heiress</i> is a look at life from the unique perspective of a young woman who has the whole world at her stiletto-clad feet.</p></p><p><b>Paris Hilton</b> is the great-granddaughter of hotel magnate Conrad Hilton.

He is an artist, celebrity photographer, and cofounder and president of the global digital photography agency WireImage.Heiress, socialite, model, actress, singer and media darling Hilton loves her life, knows how to get what she wants and matter-of-factly explains how anyone can be a glamorous, fun-loving, tiara-wearing heiress just like her. Bursting with photos of Hilton in trademark poses or with friends and family, her "confessions" are hardly scandalous, other than divulging that her hair is (gasp) naturally curly, she reveals few intimate details about herself, coyly referring to a famous scandal that once plagued her as "something I wasn't too proud of", but they display an energetic and earnest young woman fiercely loyal to her family and closest friends and determined to enjoy herself no matter what the consequences. Lightheartedly describing the "Paris Diet" (eat as much chocolate as you can, eat popcorn at night, never take diet pills) and admitting "I'm really bad about washing my face and using skin products," Hilton's indulgent and sometimes reckless lifestyle might not be sensible for everyone, but her advice to "channel your own inner heiress, create your own image, and project an extreme sense of confidence" is an empowering message for young women. Though much of the book consists of laundry lists of her favorite designers, body products, hair stylists, cities, etc., Hilton endears herself to readers by being the first to critique herself, even dedicating a chapter to photos of her fashion mistakes, and by encouraging aspiring heiresses, or girls who want to feel like one, to "always act like you're wearing an invisible crown. I do. And it's always worked for me." <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The sleekly designed settings and characters were conceptualized and developed by writer/director Brad Bird and Pixar's creative team of artists, illustrators, and designers, resulting in a celluloid sensation rich with detail. <i>The Art of The Incredibles</i> celebrates their talent, featuring concept and character sketches, storyboards, and lighting studies, and invites readers into the elaborate creative process of animation through interviews with all the key players at Pixar. With an 8-page gatefold and fabulous color art, this stunning book the only movie tie-in book for adults will delight film-goers, artists, and animation fans alike.</p><p>Mark Cotta Vaz recently completed his 19th book, a biography of Merian C.

He has served as executive consultant to the hit animated television series King of the Hill and The Simpsons .<br><br>John Lasseter is Pixar Animation Studios's executive vice-president of creative and the director of Toy Story , A Bug's Life , and Toy Story 2 . He most recently served as the executive producer of Monsters, Inc. and Finding Nemo , and is currently executive producer of The Incredibles .After almost 20 years in the vanguard of computer animation, Pixar Animation Studios (home of Toy Story, Monsters Inc., and Finding Nemo, among others) is releasing another technological wonder, The Incredibles. Brad Bird, who made The Iron Giant and is described by Pixar executive producer John Lasseter as "the ultimate geeky animation fan," dreamed up the story of the Parrs, a family of superheroes who have been forced by law to stop using their powers and live normally, sort of, until a vengeful supervillain emerges and kidnaps the father. The book describes the long process that went into making Bird's ideas a reality, with accompanying art showing the project's design at all its stages. Short interviews with Bird and his animation crew reveal the collaborative work and innovation necessary to produce a computer-generated feature focusing on humans, which are much harder to depict realistically than, say, angelfish. As the supervising technical director says, "the level of effort it takes to have the Parr family sit down to dinner is comparable to having Bob pick up a bus and throw it through a wall." It's fascinating to see the various images created in advance of the computer illustrations; on any given page, one can find the initial collages, sketches and, in some cases, digital effects that hint at how the movie comes to life. If Pixar's track record holds, The Incredibles will be a major hit, but even if it isn't, graphic arts fans and those interested in finding out how such impressive productions are realized will enjoy this inside glimpse at the movie's making. -<b>Publishers Weekly</b> <p>The Incredibles came to be in a three-dimensional idiom, not intending to simulate documentary reality but straddling a line between photorealism and cartoons. While you can sense from the film itself that these 3D figures are borne of cartoon archetypes, the actual evidence is here in the book: early drawings of Edna Mode, Bob Parr and Syndrome carry the textures and flourishes of the finished characters in the form of only of a few lines or snips of paper cut from magazines. </p><p>The book is dominated by collages from character designer Teddy Newton; gouache drawings by Lou Romano, production designer; and pencil and marker drawings by animation supervisor Tony Fucile. Highlights for fans will surely include a 1998 drawing by Lou Romano depicting the whole Parr family. What's amazing about this unique image, drawn two years before the film went into production, is that four of five family members look virtually the same here as they do in the final film. Six years and a million story changes and yet these character designs haven't budged. There is also a complete color script from the film in a giant double foldout at the center of the book. </p><p>With nearly all story references carefully eliminated, this becomes a picture book that, at least for those who haven't seen the film, can veer in many different directions. Sketches of abandoned characters and scenes share spreads with finely rendered cartoons that you might mistakenly think have been licensed back from the pages of The New Yorker. All told, in a season overflowing with movie tie-in literature, for any serious student of the art form, The Art of The Incredibles is a must-have. -<b>Animation World Magazine</b></p></p><h2>Along a Long Road</h2><p><em>Follow that road!</em> <br><br>Speed off on an eventful bicycle ride along the bold yellow road that cuts through town, by the sea, and through the country.

Simon has captured the rarely seen world of the Supreme Court where larger-than-life rivalries and personalities have an impact on the decisions that shape our lives. 8 pages of photos.</p><p>New York Law School Dean Simon has written a lucid, probing, and vibrant account of how the lives and careers of the two most influential Supreme Court Justices in the last 50 years intertwined and clashed. Except during World War II, when Black supported government restrictions on freedom, the former Southern senator and Ku Klux Klan member became the most forceful spokesperson of Bill of Rights' absolutism, often injecting his politics into a decision. Challenging him was Frankfurter, a liberal political activist who, once he was appointed to the Court, strongly espoused judicial restraint, focusing on narrow legal and procedural issues and avoiding broad political statements. Yet, as Simon shows, these "antagonists" had grudging respect for each other and, especially during their later Court years, became legal allies and supportive friends, both leaving significant legal legacies. Baker's book covers some of the same territory as Mark Silverstein's Constitutional Faiths: Felix Frankfurter, Hugo Black and the Process of Judicial Decision Making (Cornell Univ. Pr., 1984), but this is more readable, broader in scope, and makes use of new information.<br><i>- Jack Forman, Mesa Coll. Lib., San Diego</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.From 1939, when he joined the Supreme Court, until his retirement in 1962, Justice Frankfurter often engaged in vociferous arguments with Justice Black over the interpretation of constitutional law. Simon reveals how their olympian arguments shaped American law during the 23 years they served together. Tracing their very different backgrounds--Black, a rough-hewn populist senator from Alabama, was once a member of the Ku Klux Klan; Frankfurter, an Austrian-born Jew, became a Harvard law professor--Simon explains why initially they were bitter judicial enemies, yet developed a mutual respect that eventually turned into friendship. The author analyzes the cases in which the two men were most passionately involved, with Black leading the Court's "activist" wing and giving special attention to the protection of the civil rights of minorities, while Frankfurter concentrated on preserving the integrity of the judicial system itself. This is a scholarly work yet accessible to lay readers. Dean and professor of law at New York Law School, Simon is the author of Independent Journey: The Life of William O. Douglas. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Mummies and Pyramids (Magic Tree House Research Guide)</h2><p>Magic Tree House Research Guide Set (Mummies and Pyramids ~ Rain Forests ~ Titanic ~ Pirates)</p><p></p><h2>The Monsterology Handbook: A Practical Course in Monsters (Ologies)</h2><p><b>Are there monsters among us?

Steer</b>, Editor: "With what trepidation I sat down to give my editorial attentions to what was clearly the masterwork of a very erudite man, should be obvious to all who read this book." So begins a letter, written in 1894, from Dugald Steer to an Oxford friend. The letter goes on to explain how a chance meeting with Dr. Ernest Drake at the Bull's Head Tavern in Dorking, Surrey, made him more than a little curious. Skeptical at first, he took up Dr. Drake's offer to meet him at his house and St. Leonard's Forest, and to attend one of the S.A.S.D. meetings in London. There, he became further involved in Dr. Drake's work, joining him on an expedition to Scotland to try and estimate the hunting range of the Dornoch Wyrm. As he writes, the trip was, "a cause of some emotion, as many of my relative, particularly the Ross branch, come from so near."<br><br><b>Douglas Carrel</b>, Chief Draughtsman: A native of Scotland, Douglas Carrel was clearly a dragonologist of some standing, and often accompanied Dr. Drake on some of his more fruitful expeditions. In a letter from Constantinople to the editor he says, "It is with considerable sense of honour, and no small amount of pride, that I lend my hand to the compiling of this most worthy volume . . . Ultimately, I feel that all of us&#x2014;within this privileged circle in particular&#x2014;are duty-bound to preserve and perpetuate the love and lore of dragons."<br><br><b>Helen Ward</b>, Scientific Artist: Helen Ward trained as an illustrator at Brighton School of Art, although it is not known exactly when she came into contact with Dr. Drake. However a quote from her autobiography makes some things clear: "As a child I dreamed of dragons. When age allowed, I traveled. Unfortunately, several expeditions to Europe and one to that part of Russia known as Finland specifically to capture the likeness of a live dragon have ended in failure. The creatures seemed deliberately elusive....With the help of descriptions, notes, and detailed drawings made by others I have managed to illustrate these majestic creatures to the satisfaction of those more fortunate and better-informed dragonologists."&nbsp;<br><b><br>Wayne Anderson</b>, Pictorial Artist: Interested in cryptozoology from an early age, Wayne Anderson first came into contact with S.A.S.D. at one of their meetings in Wyvern Way in London. It was after a couple of trips with Drake&#x2014;to the Alps in 1878 and to Scotland in 1880&#x2014;that Wayne realized his early dragon drawings were, in fact, more life-like than he could have realized. Like most of the other collaborators on&nbsp;<i>Dragonology</i>, he has contributed to many other books for children. He enjoyed a fruitful collaboration with Helen Ward that resulted in books such as&nbsp;<i>The Tin Forest</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Dragon Machine</i>.<br><br><b>Nghiem Ta</b>, Artistic Direction: Dr. Drake met Nghiem Ta in the Fukien (now Fujian) Province of China where she was working in her grandfather's bookshop. Their shared interest in dragons became evident when he showed her a copy of the fabled&nbsp;<i>Dragon Sutra</i>&nbsp;of Hong Wei, which the monks of that monastery made for him as a gift. He asked Miss Ta if such a revered object could be bound into a book and was so impressed with her work that he later invited her to London to oversee the creation of&nbsp;<i>Dragonology</i>.</p><h2>The Golden Age of Advertising: The 60s</h2><p>Ads from the space age With the consumerist euphoria of the fifties still going strong and the race to the moon at its height, the mood of advertising in the sixties was cheerful, optimistic, and at times, revolutionary. The decade&#39;s ads touted perceived progress (such as Tang-?just add water?) while striving to reinforce good old American values. Stars like Raquel Welch, Sean Connery, Woody Allen, and Sammy Davis Jr. endorsed everything from sunglasses to bourbon to handmade suits in an attempt by Madison Avenue to urge Americans to open their wallets and participate in one giant consumer binge. Social change at the end of the era brought psychedelic swirls and liberated women and minorities to a newly conscious public. From forgotten cars such as the Studebaker Avanti, to cigarettes (?Marlboro... a man&#39;s world of flavor?) to food, clothing, consumer products, furniture, travel, and much more, this colorful collection of print ads explores the wide, wonderful world of 60s Americana.</p><p>Jim Heimann is a resident of Los Angeles, a graphic designer, writer, historian, and instructor at Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California.

With her song "I Am Woman," Reddy provided the feminist anthem of the 1970s. She became the first Australian to win a Grammy, to have her own prime-time variety show on a U.S. television network, and to have three number-one singles in the same year. <br><br>Then, at the height of her career, Reddy's world was shattered by the death of both her parents, and simultaneously, the news that she had a rare, incurable disease. In this riveting, frank, and ultimately brave memoir, Reddy reveals the emotional highs and lows that have shaped her as an artist and as a complex woman, with a rich inner life sustained by a strong spiritual faith.</p><p>Helen Reddy is a world-renowned singer/songwriter who has been an inspiration to women everywhere. She lives in Australia.World-famous for <i>I Am Woman</i> and three other albums that went gold in the 1970s, Reddy was the daughter of hard-working, Australian vaudeville performers. Onstage with her parents since she was four, Reddy was 17 when she started getting her own singing gigs. She married at 19, but her husband was abusive when she became pregnant, so she moved out. Winning a ticket to America in a local singing contest, Reddy soon worked her way to the top of the charts. Unfortunately, her next husbands were also alcoholic and/or abusive, and Reddy struggled to recover financially and emotionally from each. While Reddy's career and husband problems are shared by many women in show business, her paranormal interests are distinctive. Reddy was 11 when she first experienced "astral projection"; later, she had a dream foretelling Robert Kennedy's assassination. Reincarnation, she explains, may involve individuals or groups of people "reincarnating together to resolve unfinished business." Thus, "Elvis was formerly King Tutankhamen," and "Richard Nixon was formerly Andrew Johnson, who was formerly Thomas Paine." Reddy also explains that AIDS is actually one of the long-dormant "biblical plagues." While mainstream Reddy fans may be turned off by the New Age&#x2013;speak, alternative-reality readers won't bat an eye.

Reginald Mason is wealthy, refined, and, by all accounts, a gentleman. However, he is not a gentleman by title, a factor that pains him and his father within the Regency society that upholds station over all else. That is, until an opportunity for social advancement arises, namely, Lady Annabelle Ashton. Daughter of the Earl of Havercroft, a neighbor and enemy of the Mason family, Annabelle finds herself disgraced by a scandal, one that has left her branded as damaged goods. Besmirched by shame, the earl is only too happy to marry Annabelle off to anyone willing to have her.<p>Though Reginald Mason, Senior, wishes to use Annabelle to propel his family up the social ladder, his son does not wish to marry her, preferring instead to live the wild, single life he is accustomed to. With this, Reginald Senior serves his son an ultimatum: marry Annabelle, or make do without family funds. Having no choice, Reginald consents, and enters into a hostile engagement in which the prospective bride and groom are openly antagonistic, each one resenting the other for their current state of affairs while their respective fathers revel in their suffering.</p><p>So begins an intoxicating tale rife with dark secrets, deception, and the trials of love&#x2014;a story in which very little is as it seems.</p></p><p><b>Mary Balogh</b> grew up in Wales, and after graduating from university, moved to Saskatchewan, Canada, to teach high-school English. Her first Regency love story,<i>A Masked Deception</i>, was published in 1985. She has written more than seventy novels and almost thirty novellas since then, including the<i>New York Times</i> bestselling <i>Slightly</i> sextet and <i>Simply</i> quartet. She has won numerous awards, including Bestselling Historical of the Year from the Borders Group, and her novel<i>Simply Magic</i> was a finalist in the Quill Awards. She lives in Regina, Canada.Ah, the arranged marriage. Can even the bestselling Balogh (<i>Seducing an Angel</i>) find anything fresh in this staple of historical romance? The answer, as demonstrated in this breezy tale, is yes. Reginald Mason is a dashing young rake whose spendthrift habits so outrage his wealthy coal-merchant father that Reggie is given an ultimatum: he must marry whomever his parents choose or lose his inheritance. He's soon matched with Annabelle Ashton, daughter of an earl whose property adjoins the Masons' land. Annabelle has not only ruined a proposed marriage to a loathsome marquis but put herself outside polite society by attempting to run off with a coachman. It's the perfect match: the earl needs his daughter to marry into money, and Reggie's father longs for acceptance in high society. The young couple, naturally, resent both one another and their fathers, but the author has a surprise in store for both the reader and the scheming parents. Balogh's in fine form, stripping the story to its core to give readers a fast-moving and winning romance. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He is the author of DK's <i>Ship</i>, as well as <i>Empire of the Seas: How the Navy Forged the Modern World</i> and the highly successful two-volume history of sailing battleships, <i>The Ship of the Line</i>. Lavery was a historical consultant on Peter Weir's 2003 blockbuster <i>Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World</i>. He has also consulted on the replica constructions of Captain Cook's <i>Endeavour</i> and the emigrant ship <i>Susan Constant</i>.</p>Gr 8 Up&#x2013;Lavery offers 5000 years of ocean history in this lavishly illustrated and readable work. Although stating that the oceans can never be conquered, he narrates many stories of bravery, perseverance, and greed that resulted in the exploration of unknown worlds. Beginning with the first sailors of Polynesia, the Mediterranean, China, and Arabia, and covering oceangoing activities until modern times, this book has a vast reach. Much of the text consists of first-person narratives, often personal and exciting in the telling of great dangers and adventures. Included are discussions of the great explorations of the New World; the unbelievable travels of the extraordinary 15th-century Chinese seaman Zhen He, covering 30,000 miles in a flotilla totaling 27,000 men; the vast Viking journeys; and the use of naval power as a force for conquest. In the modern era, luxury ocean liners, America's Cup races, and World Wars are reviewed as well as the vast oversea migrations of the 19th century. The voices quoted give substance to the facts and figures outlining victory and loss. Piracy is a constant theme; whether for personal gain or in the employ of monarchs, the oceans were fair game for theft and plunder. Fittingly the last chapter relates to the treacherous Somali pirates of today. Photos, reproductions, diagrams, or maps appear on almost every page. The well-researched and popularly presented text is aided by an ample glossary, bibliography, and index. Useful for research and enjoyable for leisure reading for students interested in naval history, exploration, and adventure.&#x2013;Eva Elisabeth VonAncken, formerly at Trinity-Pawling School, Pawling, NY&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

The saxophone has insinuated itself into virtually every musical idiom that has come along since its birth as well as into music with traditions thousands of years old. But it has also been controversial, viewed as a symbol of decadence, immorality and lasciviousness: it was banned in Japan, saxophonists have been sent to Siberian lockdown by Communist officials, and a pope even indicted it.<br> <br>Segell outlines the saxophone's fascinating history while he highlights many of its legendary players, including Benny Carter, Illinois Jacquet, Sonny Rollins, Lee Konitz, Phil Woods, Branford Marsalis, and Michael Brecker. <i>The Devil's Horn</i> explores the saxophone's intersections with social movement and change, the innovative acoustical science behind the instrument, its struggles in the world of "legit" music, and the mystical properties that seduce all who fall under its influence. Colorful, evocative, and richly informed, <i>The Devil's Horn</i> is an ingenious portrait of one of the most popular instruments in the world.<br></p><p>Michael Segell is an editor at the <i>Daily News</i>, an amateur percussionist and saxophone player, and a professional music lover. He lives with his wife and children in New York City and Long Eddy, New York.<br><br>Michael Segell's writing has appeared in numerous publications, including <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>Rolling Stone</i>, <i>Sports Illustrated</i>, and <i>Esquire</i>, where he wrote the popular column "The Male Mind" for three years. He has received two National Magazine Award nominations for his work. <br>The Devil's Horn<br>1. THE GHOST CHILDHe was known as <i>Le petit Sax, le revenant</i> (the ghost-child) to the citizens of his village, Dinant, in Belgium. After one of his many nearly fatal accidents, his mother lamented, &#x201c;The child is doomed to suffer; he won&#x2019;t live.&#x201d; Almost before he could walk, little Adolphe Sax, christened Antoine Joseph in 1814, was fascinated with the alchemical magic performed every day in his father&#x2019;s workshop, where the most elemental materials were recombined into the finest brass, which was in turn fashioned into an exquisite musical instrument. Although Charles Joseph Sax, who had been appointed Belgium&#x2019;s chief instrument maker by William I of Orange, was eager to pass on his skills to his firstborn son, agents of misfortune conspired relentlessly to remove the boy from the land of the living. When he was two Adolphe fell down a flight of stairs, smashed his head on a rock, and lay comatose for a week. A year later, toddling around his father&#x2019;s atelier, he mistook sulfate of zinc for milk, gulped it down, and nearly expired. Subsequent poisonings involved white lead, copper oxide, and arsenic. He swallowed a needle, burned himself severely on a stove, and was badly scorched again by exploding gunpowder, which blew him across the workshop floor. He was again rendered comatose by a heavy slate tile that dislodged from a roof and landed on his head. When he was ten, a villager happened to spot the drowning lad when, after falling into a river, he was eddying, facedown and unconscious, in a whirlpool above a miller&#x2019;s gate. The villager just managed to pluck him from the water. Before he entered adolescence, his head was scarred by the repeated blows, and one side of his body was badly disfigured by burns.But his misadventures proved instructive, hardening him for the nasty battles that would plague him as he tried to launch an ingenious musical invention, a serpentine horn whose provenance he secured by naming it after himself. From the moment his lips first touched his saxophone prototype, Adolphe Sax would face a juggernaut of slander, theft, litigation, forced bankruptcies, and attempts on his life that tried to suppress his new sound, a sound never before heard in nature, a sound that promised to change the timbre and soul of music wherever it was played.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;By 1842, the twenty-eight-year-old Adolphe Sax was widely recognized as one of the world&#x2019;s top acoustical craftsmen. Far more skilled and ambitious than his brilliant father, he set out on a late-winter day from Brussels for Paris, then the musical-instrument manufacturing center of the world. In addition to his personal belongings, he carried with him an enormous brass horn, almost as tall as he, that he had fabricated in his father&#x2019;s workshop, where he had thrived after surviving his calamitous childhood. It was the most recent creation of his already remarkable career. At fifteen he had fabricated a clarinet and two flutes from ivory, considered exquisite specimens by judges at the 1830 Brussels Industrial Exposition. Before he was twenty he had created a new fingering system on the soprano clarinet and reinvented the bass clarinet, transforming the unreliable and mostly unplayable instrument into a regal, elegant woodwind that provided a rich bottom to any instrumental configuration and, remarkably, played in tune. The newly rehabilitated instrument had quickly been adopted as a standard member of the woodwind group and its inventor acknowledged as an engineer of great promise in the musical capitals of Europe.Despite his success, Sax was feeling grossly maligned and unappreciated. For several years the judges of the Belgian national exhibition had refused to grant him the first prize for his innovations, reasoning that though the precocious designer may have deserved them, were he to receive the exhibition&#x2019;s highest honors at such a young age, he would have nothing else to aspire to. The year before, in 1841, Sax had prepared to submit for review his new bass horn, the as-yet-unnamed saxophone, the first in a proposed family of seven that would reconfigure the sonic organization of military and symphonic orchestras. After glimpsing the instrument&#x2014;a brass-and-reed hybrid that joined the body of an ophicleide, a sinuous conical horn, with a clarinet-style mouthpiece&#x2014;the first wholly new one to emerge since the clarinet had been invented a hundred years before, a jealous competitor apparently booted it across the floor, damaging it so badly it was unfit for exhibition. Disappointed and disgusted, Sax had packed his belongings, carefully wrapped up his mangled creation, and fled Brussels. When he arrived in Paris he had thirty francs in his pocket.It was the first of many attempts to suppress this intrusive latecomer, this interloper, which, unlike wind instruments with ancient roots, could trace its lineage only as far as the revolutionary design specifications of a visionary acoustical scientist. Like every subsequent injunction over the next century against the saxophone and its &#x201c;carnal,&#x201d; &#x201c;voluptuous&#x201d; sound&#x2014;by heads of state, local police, educators, symphonic conductors, film censors, and a host of other moral arbiters, including the Vatican&#x2014;it failed.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Brash, arrogant, handsome, with a lush, full beard and bedroom eyes, Adolphe Sax was the embodiment of the fiery nineteenth-century Romantic. Enormously self-confident&#x2014;&#x201c;In life there are conquerors and the conquered; I most prefer to be among the first,&#x201d; he often said&#x2014;Sax was sure that his invention would have profound and everlasting repercussions for music and its practitioners. A brief trip to Paris in the spring of 1839 had strengthened his conviction; the well-regarded composers Fran�ois-Antoine Habeneck, Giacomo Meyerbeer, and Jacques Fromental Hal�vy, to whom he had shown the new bass clarinet and a few of his retooled brass instruments, praised him lavishly during his visit. Sax was convinced he would find a learned and appreciative audience in the salons and conservatories of France and receive the recognition he had been denied in Brussels.Paris represented a fresh start in other ways, too. As a young man, Sax had shown a remarkable ability to develop enemies. Not long after he reinvented the bass clarinet, a jealous artist at the Brussels Grande Harmonie declared he would quit the orchestra if it adopted the new instrument by the designer, who was also a highly talented musician. Sax challenged him to a musical duel&#x2014;a strategy he deployed frequently with his critics. In his adopted city of Paris, he decided on a new tack. He invited the composer Hector Berlioz, who wrote a feuilleton for the highbrow <i>Journal des d�bats,</i> to review his instruments, including the improved clarinets and the prototype for his new bass horn. On June 12, 1842, Berlioz devoted much of his column to Sax, &#x201c;a man of lucid mind, far-seeing, tenacious, steadfast and skilled beyond words.&#x201d; He called the new instrument <i>le Saxophon</i>, an eponym the egomaniacal young genius wholly endorsed, and predicted the instrument would &#x201c;meet with the support of all friends of music.&#x201d; Attempting to describe the unique effects the horn has on the human ear, Berlioz wrote elsewhere, &#x201c;It cries, sighs and dreams. It possesses a crescendo and can gradually diminish its sound until it is only an echo of an echo of an echo&#x2014;until its sound becomes crepuscular.&#x201d; In another article, he said, &#x201c;The timbre of the saxophone has something vexing and sad about it in the high register; the low notes to the contrary are of a grandiose nature, one could say pontifical. For works of a mysterious and solemn character, the saxophone is, in my mind, the most beautiful low voice known to this day.&#x201d;Other composers echoed the praise, even though they had heard the instrument before it underwent its final refinements. The opera composer Gioacchino Rossini declared that &#x201c;it produced the finest blending of sound that I have met with.&#x201d; Claude Lavoix described its &#x201c;particular color of sadness and resignation.&#x201d; A couple of months after Sax arrived in Paris, Fromental Hal�vy exhorted him, &#x201c;Hurry and finish your new family of instruments and come and succour to the poor composers that are looking for something new and to the public that is demanding it, if not to the world itself.&#x201d; By 1843, Sax had put the final touches on his first prototype, a B-flat bass with a main body that was still shaped like an ophicleide.The bombastic Berlioz, perhaps recognizing a kindred spirit in his feisty, irritable new friend, helped promote the instrument in every way he knew how. He scored his <i>Chant Sacre</i> for an ensemble of Sax&#x2019;s instruments, including the B-flat bass saxophone. In early 1844 the work was performed as <i>Hymne pour les instruments de Sax</i> at the Salle Herz, with Sax playing his bass prototype in what was probably the first public performance of the colossal new instrument. Later that year, Georges Kastner used the saxophone, this time a bass in C, in his biblical opera <i>The Last King of Juda,</i> performed at the Paris Conservatory, its only performance ever.Sax also wooed French royalty. A conservatory student for much of his youth, Sax could play, and play well, virtually every woodwind and brass instrument. At the Paris Industrial Exhibition in 1844, he kept his invention hidden from view (because it was not yet patented, he was then calling it a contrabass clarinet), quietly revealing it to only a few trusted acquaintances. One of them was Lieutenant General Comte de Rumigny, the king&#x2019;s aide-de-camp, who arranged a showcase for Sax and a quartet of musicians before King Louis Philippe, Queen Marie Am�lie, and two of their sons at court.Sax envisioned a major ...</p><h2>Woven Treasures</h2><p><p>With weaving enjoying a resurgence in popularity among crafters and cottage industries worldwide, this guide enables novice weavers to explore basic folk techniques and styles to produce beautiful and evocative handcrafted works of art.

Though it was just a few blocks north of the office in Union Square where I worked as an editor, I&#x2019;d never been within a two-block radius&#x2014;the miracle of living in New York is the way you fashion and refashion each bit of it, until you&#x2019;ve somehow made it your own. I circled the block, fashioning it, three times before finally heading in, looking foolish in my brand-new Adidas boxing shoes, pulled-high athletic socks, and neon yellow shorts. &#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d; the counter guy with the scraggly billy-goat beard said, eyeballing me. I told him I was looking for an acquaintance, Chris Lewarne, a rep from the boxing charity that arranged my fight.<br> <br>He didn&#x2019;t know who Chris was, he mumbled, but waved me down the stairs. I nodded back, descending into the bowels of the gym and thinking about how I&#x2019;d gotten the idea from movies that men spent a lot of time in amenable, intimate silences, laced through with well-placed words that telegraphed deep truths, like the pivotal scene in every drama about fathers and sons. I suppose I had indeed spent a lot more time not knowing what to say since my transition. Silence was a kind of defense mechanism, especially in the halting stop-and-start dialogues I found myself muscling through with uncomfortable male relatives, or other people&#x2019;s fathers.<br> <br>I felt the front-desk guy&#x2019;s eyes on my back as I hustled away. This was the sort of place I would need to be watchful, to be careful to whom I spoke and what I said. I had already decided that I would not tell anyone that I was trans. I&#x2019;d decided it deep in my lizard brain as I&#x2019;d circled the block before walking in, or maybe after I first reached out to Chris, or actually when I pitched the story to my bosses at Quartz, or, come to think of it, back when I&#x2019;d first conceived of writing it. It was not lost on me that I was a historical anomaly, and that it was a function of a wave of newfound goodwill toward trans people that I&#x2019;d been able to spend the years since I first went on testosterone living openly as a trans man with few negative consequences (and that trans people who were not white or male did not benefit as wholly from this new friendliness and awareness of our lives as I did). Still, I suspected from the moments that I moved anonymously through space that the understanding that my male friends especially had about my body impacted the way they treated me, and my goal was to go undercover, to embed, never mind to stay safe among men who liked to beat each other up for fun.<br> <br>In the coming months, that decision would dog me, not least because it highlighted a thorny truth: that, for all the world, I was just another dude in expensive Nikes learning to hit other guys in the face. The relationship between us mostly white men in high-tech training gear with pristine $180 Reyes gloves and the mostly black and brown coaches and (real) fighters using garbage bags to shed water weight wasn&#x2019;t usually tense, but it was classed. Real boxing gyms, dank spots that were actual training grounds for Golden Gloves champs, were rarely open to gangly newbs like me, but a spate of legendary gyms such as Mendez followed a profitable business model that attracted scrappy Olympic hopefuls, washed-up amateurs looking to become personal trainers or to coach the Next Big Thing, and high-rolling charity fighters alike. I learned quickly that the arrangement had an uneasy economy: amateur boxers tired of the grind could charge white-collar guys (and some women) more than they&#x2019;d ever make on the fight circuit, and attorneys and hedge-fund managers never forced to expose their bodies to risk of any kind could do so for the thrill and bragging rights.<br> <br>Pro boxing hadn&#x2019;t found a poster child who captured pop culture since Mike Tyson, but the idea of boxing, especially among the hip and well-heeled, had entered a new heyday post&#x2013;Fight Club. The sport that produced Muhammad Ali increasingly lacked in both heroes and the deeper social narrative of his era, leaving a vacuum eventually filled by a boxing-fitness craze perfect for Instagrammable moments. As I walked through the basement door at Mendez in 2015, it was clear that the latest converts were a certain sort of Wall Street guy, in an extension of the &#x201c;wellness as luxury&#x201d; trend that had also launched the spinning craze SoulCycle. (A hedge-fund manager I met at another boxing gym confirmed this. &#x201c;I would have done blow with a client in the eighties, or gone to a strip club in the nineties,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But now when I want to impress someone, I take him boxing.&#x201d;)<br> <br>The stink of sweat made my eyes water as I scanned the room, eventually finding my friend Chris, a beefy, smiley Canadian, watching two other white guys in their midthirties pummel each other inelegantly in the ring near the locker rooms.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good work, you guys,&#x201d; Chris said charitably, chewing on a toothpick. He wore the classic Adidas triple-striped pants, a Haymakers T-shirt, and a light beard, but was the kind of handsome that required zero styling to appear stylish.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thomas!&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so glad you&#x2019;re here, man.&#x201d;<br> <br>Chris&#x2019;s fight name was the Cuddly Canadian. I&#x2019;d seen his photos on social media from his fight two years before and knew he was on the board for Haymakers for Hope, a charity that raised money for cancer research by arranging glitzy bouts between brokers and day traders and venture capitalists with no boxing experience. He was the only reason I had a good shot of getting on the fight card at such short notice&#x2014;just five months before the event. I was still surprised that my plan had worked, that Quartz had invested in the reporting, that anybody would let a total novice fight in Madison Square Garden with just a few months&#x2019; training. But I was still adjusting to the way I&#x2019;d been treated since I&#x2019;d transitioned: the ease with which my ideas were often executed, the ways my expertise was assumed before I&#x2019;d proven it, the serious faces people made when I spoke, the heady faith the world seemed to suddenly have in me.<br> <br>To be clear, the Before me wasn&#x2019;t feminine. I don&#x2019;t know what it&#x2019;s like to be wolf-whistled or be told to smile. I was a short-haired tomboy who grew into a swaggering teen, regularly escorted out of women&#x2019;s rooms by mall security. My younger siblings called me their &#x201c;big brother,&#x201d; but underneath my practiced cool, I was still raised to fear men: men in dark streets or clustered outside bars; sketchy drivers; solo figures on park benches or in parked cars or on trains with their hands moving frantically in their laps. I didn&#x2019;t question this low-grade, persistent anxiety or imagine a world where it didn&#x2019;t exist. Masculinity was, as far as I was concerned, epitomized by my stepfather, whose years of sexual abuse began when I was four and looking at an anatomy book (&#x201c;These are boy parts,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d said, a simple sentence that separated any notion of my body from his for the next twenty-five years), and the parade of strangers whose threat crowded my days long after the abuse stopped.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s just how guys are, I thought, glad to stand apart from their crassness and bulk, even as my body began to feel estranged from me. So what if I had to cross my eyes to look in a mirror?<br> <br>&#x201c;Men,&#x201d; Mom said sourly, as we listened to NPR detail Bill Clinton&#x2019;s infidelity. They were holding us back, the bad dads and the mass murderers and child abusers, the wife beaters and the harassing bosses and the corrupt politicians. Not until I was much older did I realize how complicated her feelings were, that she loved men too, and that her anger was forged in that love: obviously for my brother, and her father, but also for the coworkers that stood up for her, the ex-boyfriends, the civil rights activists she marched alongside in the National Mall, listening to Martin Luther King Jr. announce that he had a dream.<br> <br>Decades later, when I first had to tell her who I was, when I asked her to call me Thomas, the memory of the way she&#x2019;d said &#x201c;men&#x201d; replayed on a loop as I dialed. I&#x2019;d picked the name as an offering, after her brother who&#x2019;d passed. &#x201c;I love you,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d said, so simple and true, and I&#x2019;d been so grateful for her, my mother.<br> <br>All you need to know about her is that after I transitioned and despite everything, what matters most is that she never said &#x201c;men&#x201d; that way to me again.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>Chris, a lawyer between full-time jobs, had grown out his hair since I&#x2019;d last seen him and now worked as Haymakers&#x2019; de facto general counsel, riding his motorcycle to various Haymakers-approved gyms, keeping an eye on fighters&#x2019; weights and progress, occasionally hopping in the ring himself for fun.<br> <br>Bearded and swarthy, standing beside him, I felt like the brainy villain next to the hero in an action movie. &#x201c;This is going to be awesome!&#x201d; he reiterated, and I nodded uneasily. Then he introduced me to my potential coach: Errol, an impeccably groomed, bald-headed black dude, who looked at me warily. I wondered, self-consciously, if he presumed me a certain sort of white man, or if his assessment was a colder, more physical one.<br> <br>&#x201c;Have you ever played any sports?&#x201d; he asked, which didn&#x2019;t clarify things either way for me, though he seemed a little encouraged when I told him I&#x2019;d been a goalie, a position famous for drawing only the truly bananas, a quality I assumed would help me in the ring. This was my inference, of course. Maybe he was just glad to know that a guy that was five feet six inches and 135 pounds wasn&#x2019;t afraid of getting hit in the face.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get to work,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Can you run a six-minute mile?&#x201d;<br> <br>Definitely not, I thought. &#x201c;Probably,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>Wu-Tang blared over a bell that rang out every three minutes and the constant thwap of men hitting bags, mitts, each other. I did not run a six-minute mile, but I did run three miles in twenty-five minutes, driven by adrenaline and pure terror through a hazing that lasted two grueling hours. Afterward, from the floor, I watched other men&#x2019;s sweat condense on the ceiling and fought the urge to vomit, feeling proud of myself and strange for feeling proud of myself.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got short arms, but decent strength,&#x201d; Errol said, from somewhere above me. I couldn&#x2019;t see him through the sweat stinging my eyes. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see you tomorrow.&#x201d; Then he was gone.<br> <br>I hauled myself up, and Chris and I sat on the bench kitty-corner to the ring in what actually was companionable silence for a minute or two, but mostly because I couldn&#x2019;t breathe. We knew each other only vaguely, and mostly from social media. We weren&#x2019;t, however, actual friends. Not that Chris seemed to make any distinction.<br> <br>&#x201c;You did great,&#x201d; he said, smiling sunnily. That wasn&#x2019;t exactly true, but I&#x2019;d take it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Listen, don&#x2019;t tell Errol I&#x2019;m trans, okay?&#x201d; I asked, once I could catch my breath again.<br> <br>He looked at me curiously, but told me not to worry about it. I meant to tell him it was to not compromise my reporting, but a part of me knew that wasn&#x2019;t exactly true. As we watched a guy across the way do one hundred sit-ups, pause thirty seconds, then do one hundred more, I realized how scared I was. I wore my insistence that I be taken seriously, an inheritance from Before, differently on this body. With nobody challenging me anymore, that drive now just looked like standard-issue male confidence. I felt an acute awareness, sitting next to Chris, of the inches and muscle the other guys had on me, and within their bodies the potential for my own spectacular failure.<br> <br>After he was gone, I changed furtively in the locker room, listening to two dudes talk about a cross-country trip they&#x2019;d taken on their motorcycles and hiding my nakedness by facing the wall of lockers while slipping quickly out of my shorts.<br> <br>&#x201c;You got a fight?&#x201d; the smaller of the two guys asked me.<br> <br>I flinched at the attention. &#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; I mumbled, &#x201c;just a charity one.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t matter,&#x201d; he said. The other guy nodded his agreement, and I couldn&#x2019;t help the swell in my chest.<br> <br>I had a fight! I walked all the way home, that night, thirty blocks, like the king of New York.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>&#x201c;The first jab better be a warning,&#x201d; Errol said the next day. I pretended to be in less pain than I was as we practiced keeping our guards up, looking over our gloves, crab-walking around the ring, then turning into position quickly, so as to expose as little of our bodies as possible. This defensive style was cagey, smart. It was about staying safe by keeping your distance, always being ready, never letting down your guard.<br> <br>I was familiar with the concept.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can see you,&#x201d; Errol said, unnerving me, his gloves covering his face. Then he popped me on the side of the head. &#x201c;But if you&#x2019;re not watching, you can&#x2019;t see me. If you can&#x2019;t see me, you won&#x2019;t be ready. If you&#x2019;re not ready, you&#x2019;ll get hit.&#x201d;<br> <br>I pushed through one more round, then another. He had me close out the night on the jump rope, which I immediately tripped over. Why are you doing this? I could hear my mom asking.<br> <br>She always seemed to me larger than even the history I read about in school textbooks. She traveled on a Eurail pass with some girlfriends back when women didn&#x2019;t do such things. She&#x2019;d worked for Ted Kennedy and met his brother John when she won the Westinghouse Science fair in high school. Even after her marriage fell apart and she couldn&#x2019;t find work; even after she moved to a depressing town near where she grew up in central Pennsylvania; even when she couldn&#x2019;t stop drinking&#x2014;she always seemed one step away from getting back on track, forever one turn away from her best self, the working-class high school girl tutored by the principal himself, she was that full of potential.<br> <br>A medical &#x201c;crisis,&#x201d; her doctors explained to my sister and brother and me in the terrible hospital room a year earlier, is a crossroads where the patient either becomes healthier or dies. Mom, who, when she found out that her husband had been abusing me, put her hand on the center of my chest and told me I had a golden core that no one could touch. I knew I was at a crossroads too, fighting for the future that eluded her, working to become the kind of man we could both be proud of. She was in the ICU in September when the nicest doctor of all took us into a special carpet-lined room with a big wooden table and told us, plainly, that she would not live. When she died a few days after, she passed a mighty hunger on to me. Nine months later, it was within me, a hunger that lived.<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s taking his time with that jump rope,&#x201d; some joker said, and my cheeks burned. My legs were heavy, but sweat poured off me like a second self, washing away.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>It felt good to see the guys nod hello those first weeks of training, even if I was skinny and kept to myself. Soon everybody knew I had a fight, and that made me one of them. So what if I couldn&#x2019;t even throw a straight right? At least I wasn&#x2019;t there for the cardio.<br> <br>But I was also wary of this new, oddly warrior-like ego. I fought not to fall under the thrall of these alphas and the pride I sometimes felt when they noticed me.

He lives in Hatfield, Massachusetts.<br> &nbsp;Preface <br><br>SOMEWHERE, ALWAYS, the sun is rising, and somewhere, always, the birds are singing. As spring and summer oscillate between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, so, too, does this singing planet pour forth song, like a giant player piano, in the north, then the south, and back again, as it has now for the 150 million years since the first birds appeared.<br> Ten thousand species strong, their voices and styles are as diverse as they are delightful. Some species learn their songs, just as we humans learn to speak, but others seem to leave nothing to chance, encoding the details of songs in nucleotide sequences in the DNA. Of those that learn, some do so only early in life, some throughout life; some from fathers, some from eventual neighbors after leaving home; some only from their own kind, some mimicking other species as well. Some species sing in dialects, others not. It is mostly he who sings, but she sometimes does, too. Some songs are proclaimed from the treetops, others whispered in the bushes; some ramble for minutes on end, others are offered in just a split second. Some birds have thousands of different songs, some only one, and some even none. Some sing all day, some all night. Some are pleasing to our ears, and some not.<br> It is this diversity that I celebrate. How the sounds of these species differ from each other is the first step to appreciating them, of course, but those questions quickly give way to why&#x201d; questions. Why do some learn and others not? Why do dialects occur in some species and not others? Why is it mainly the male who sings? It is these and similar why&#x201d; questions that so intrigue us biologists as we try to understand the individual voices that contribute to the avian chorus.<br> In writing about our singing planet, I can focus on only a few of its voices. The thirty stories told here are personal journeys, ones that I have traveled over the past thirty years in my quest to understand the singing bird.<br> Many are based on my own research and are years in the making. Others are based on just several days&#x2019; experience, or even less, as I seek out birds that illustrate the research of friends and colleagues who share my passions. No matter the source, each story is based on listening and on learning how to hear an individual bird use its sounds, and each story illustrates some of the fundamentals of the science called avian bioacoustics.&#x201d; Together, I hope these stories and their sounds reveal how to listen, the meaning in the music, and why we should care.<br><br>Copyright � 2005 by Donald Kroodsma.

Robert Dahl explores this vital tension between the Americans&#39; belief in the legitimacy of their constitution and their belief in the principles of democracy. Dahl starts with the assumption that the legitimacy of the American Constitution derives solely from its utility as an instrument of democratic governance. Dahl demonstrates that, due to the context in which it was conceived, our constitution came to incorporate significant antidemocratic elements. Because the Framers of the Constitution had no relevant example of a democratic political system on which to model the American government, many defining aspects of our political system were implemented as a result of short-sightedness or last-minute compromise. Dahl highlights those elements of the American system that are most unusual and potentially antidemocratic: the federal system, the bicameral legislature, judicial review, presidentialism, and the electoral college system. The political system that emerged from the world&#39;s first great democratic experiment is unique-no other well-established democracy has copied it. How does the American constitutional system function in comparison to other democratic systems? How could our political system be altered to achieve more democratic ends? To what extent did the Framers of the Constitution build features into our political system that militate against significant democratic reform? Refusing to accept the status of the American Constitution as a sacred text, Dahl challenges us all to think critically about the origins of our political system and to consider the opportunities for creating a more democratic society.</p><p>Robert A. Dahl is Sterling Professor Emeritus of Political Science at Yale University and past president of the American Political Science Association. He is the author of numerous books, including Who Governs?, Democracy and Its Critics, and On Democracy, all published by Yale University Press."This book is vintage Dahl at the highest possible level. It is lucid, acutely analytic, literate, and both consistent with the long series of previous books by Dahl and new in its details and broad contours."&#x2014;Fred Greenstein, Princeton University</p><h2>Danish Chairs</h2><p>Danish Chairs is the only book to survey the innovative, prolific output of Denmark&#39;&#39;s design elite durin g the years when they turned again and again to the chair. E ach style is shown, accompanied by technical details and not es about the designer. &#39;</p><p>Reviews from: THE MODERNISM MAGAZINE I.D. MAGAZINE by Cara Greenberg The greatest revelation of Danish Chairs by Noritsugu Oda is that Arne Jacobsen and Hans Wegner were only the tip of the iceberg. Great Danes in chair design were many and this book includes unfamiliar names like Helge Vestergaard Jensen, designer of an extraordinary 1955 nylon-cord &#34;racket&#34; chair, and Edvard and Tove Kindt-Larsen, prolific in Denmark from the 1930s through &#39;50s, but unknown in the U.S.; variants on familiar designs, like Poul Kjaerhom&#39;s easy chair of 1971, a wooden-legged version of this more common steel-and-leather designs; and rarely-seen pieces by well-known designers such as Finn Juhl&#39;s extravagantly shaped pelican chair of 1940. A preface by Takako Murakami, elegantly translated from the Japanese, goes a long way toward explaining how the Japanese bring such a fresh and clear eye to the subject of chairs. Their fascination with the Western furniture form seem only natural when one considers that the chair made its appearance in Japan only forty years ago. Oda, a professor of arts and crafts at Hokkaido University, documents the spare perfection of Danish chair design from the early twentieth century to the present decade in uniformly lit. 360-degree views of some 200 chairs, accompanied by the author&#39;s schematic line drawings. Why the Danes? Denmark in the twentieth century possessed all the necessary conditions for the development of excellence in furniture design, argues Murakami: &#34;a far-reaching understanding of traditional woodworking and modern engineering techniques, the presence of highly trained craftspeople...the unparalleled creativity of its designers and their recognition of consumer&#39;s needs and desires.&#34; On perusing Danish Chairs, we can only marvel at a small nation&#39;s consistency in producing cultural artifacts of such exceptional craftsmanship, beauty, and utility. by Jonah Brucker-Cohen There&#39;s no mistaking the look of an early modern Danish chair: strong but spare architecture with elegant, organic curves. Mid-century Danish designers felt a moral obligation to improve the quality of the consumer&#39;s life, and they did so through uncompromising craftsmanship. With diagrams and photos (most in black-and-white, but some in color), Oda gives a full 360-degree view of each chair, brief but often fascinating descriptions and a concise bio of every innovator whose work is included. The author&#39;s passion for the material is obvious: It took him 12 years to take all the photos for this book, and the better part of a lifetime to collect the chairs.Noritsugu Oda is a professor in the arts and crafts department of Hokkaido University in Japan.

A supernatural battle between good and evil when the Warrens arranged for an exorcism for William Ramsey whose bizarre seizures terrified the town and let people to believe he was possessed. .</p><p>The legend of the werewolf is as old as man himself. From Ed and Lorraine Warren, the world's most famous demonologists, comes perhaps their most incredible and horrifying case: the true story of William Ramsey, whose bizarre seizures terrified the English town of Southend-on-Sea. Believing Ramsey to be a victim of demonic possession, the Warrens arranged for the rite of exorcism to be performed. Not since The Exorcist shocked the nation has there been such such a horrifying account of a supernatural battle between good and evil within the soul of one human. <p> Don't miss the blockbuster films based on the Warrens' true experiences, The Conjuring and Annabelle.</p>With werewolves now a hot fiction item (for instance, Michael Cadnum's St. Peter's Wolf, p. 416, or Dennis Danvers's Wilderness, p. 266), it's no surprise to see a ``true'' account of the hairy beasts. Too bad it's by the Warrens, those professional ``demonologists'' last seen facing down Satan and his minions (and Bigfoot too) in Ghost Hunters (1989). Before the Warrens enter the chronicle at hand (told in narrative, Q&amp;A-interview, and diary forms), though, we're regaled in the alphabet-block prose of their usual coauthor, Chase, with the sad saga of Bill Ramsey, the book's fourth credited author. Ramsey, you see, was the werewolf--well, actually it turns out that he wasn't a werewolf at all but, as the text describes him, a ``wolfman'' like Lon Chaney, Jr., in those 40's horror films--well, actually it turns out that he wasn't a wolfman at all but a young working-class British bloke who thought he was changing into a wolf, which is why he tried to bite all those friends and young ladies and cops and nurses. But it wasn't his fault: The Devil made him do it. Which is where the Warrens come in. In England on a promotional tour (neatly continued in the text: ```The Warrens are the most fascinating people I've ever interviewed,' '' an anonymous TV producer is quoted as saying), they learn of Ramsey's plight and pinpoint it as demonic possession. A bit of persuasion and Ramsey is off with them to the States, where their old colleague Bishop McKenna, also last seen in Ghost Hunters (``He's a very earnest and devout man. You just don't see his kind around a lot anymore,'' says Ed) exorcises the invading ``demon,'' setting Ramsey free. Skeptics, please note the Warrens' assurance that this is ``a carefully documented'' case (they forgot to include the documentation, though).

Reprint.</p><p>Faye Kellerman's latest thriller features Cynthia Decker, daughter of Peter Decker, familiar to readers of the author's previous novels featuring the L.A. detective and his Orthodox Jewish wife Rina Lazarus. In Kellerman's earlier books, we've met Cynthia briefly as a difficult adolescent upset by her parents' divorce and later as an Ivy League college student with an interest in following her overly protective father into the family business: solving crimes. Now Cynthia's a young L.A. cop who's the subject of what at first seems like innocent-enough teasing from her colleagues. They think she's snooty and standoffish and riding on her father's reputation. Actually, she's all of those things, which makes for a somewhat less than sympathetic heroine: <blockquote>Beaudry said, "Every time we start shooting the bull, talking about the day, you say things like, 'Yeah, my father once had a case like that.'"<p> "I'm trying to <i>relate</i>."</p><p> "It pisses people off. It makes them think that their experiences are nothin' special. Everyone wants to feel special. You already feel special because you've got all this college. You gotta remember that the average Joe on the force is a high school graduate, maybe a couple of years at a junior college like me. If you're real smart, okay, you do a four-year state, then enter the academy with the idea of doing the gold."</p><p> "Like my dad--"</p><p> "<i>Stop</i> mentioning your dad. He isn't a legend, Decker, he's a pencil pusher."</p></blockquote> As the teasing escalates, Cindy's stalked, threatened, and finally frightened, although it pains her to admit it. There's a killer on the loose, and even if she's not the best cop on the force, she knows enough to turn to her father for help. But first, she has a brief affair with one of the men under his command. It seems a little too obvious a ploy for Daddy's attention and hardly adds to her character--we already know she's immature and a bit of a bitch. But at least this maneuver brings Peter back on the scene, allowing Kellerman to hit her stride as she gets back to a character who holds the reader's interest because he's more than two-dimensional. Sadly, Cindy's not quite ready for prime time; perhaps she'll grow up in her next outing. Or better yet, Kellerman will bring us more adventures by Peter and Rina. <i>--Jane Adams</i><p>Faye Kellerman lives with her husband, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Jonathan Kellerman, in Los Angeles, California, and Santa Fe, New Mexico. </p></p><h2>The Electrifying Nervous System (God&#39;s Wondrous Machine)</h2><p><p>Discover Your Design!</p> <p>Developed by a homeschooling pediatrician, this book focuses on the amazing design and functionality of the human body's nervous system.

It is his mother who is awakened in the final picture to find Jason asleep on top of the refrigerator and father asleep midstep with a toe tied to a piece of rope. What starts off as a humorous idea is run into the ground with repetition in the text so that even the humor of the final picture is lost in the stupidity of the story.

Brown and Werner's <i>The Jimtown Store Cookbook</i>, written with Michael McLaughlin, offers 130 of Jimtown's best recipes--robust yet sophisticated dishes that range from Pumpkin Chipotle Soup and Paella Salad with Seared Tuna and Shellfish to Maple-Glazed Meat Loaf and Duck and Olive Ragout with Buttered Noodles. The store also has committed itself to local food producers, and their products help define Jimtown's globe-spanning yet all-American cuisine. This is a truly accomplished blend, and readers will find a ready supply of tantalizing recipes for everyday and special-occasion eating.<p> Brown and Werner first spotted Jimtown on the Fourth of July, so it's only fitting that they've developed a mouthwatering barbecue repertoire, with many accompanying sauces, condiments, pickles, and relishes. These signature items include Romesco Sauce and Lupe's Tomatillo Salsa; a number of these are fitting accompaniments to dishes like Grilled Fish Tacos, Roast Pork Loin with Bacon and Rosemary, and Grilled Chicken Breasts with Herbed Honey Butter. Other Jimtown specialties include sandwiches like roast beef with horseradish sauce and desserts such as Bittersweet Chocolate Pinwheel Cake and Buttermilk Pie. With the purveyors' cooking tips and menus for entertaining, the book, like the store, rewards digging into. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p><p>Before they moved to California to open the Jimtown Store, Carrie Brown was a professional artist and intuitive cook, and John Werner, her late husband, was an original partner in New York's legendary specialty food store The Silver Palate.

John Adams asked Thomas Jefferson in 1815. "The war? That was no part of the Revolution. It was only an effect and consequence of it." As the distinguished historian Thomas P. Slaughter shows in this landmark book, the long process of revolution reached back more than a century before 1776, and it touched on virtually every aspect of the colonies' laws, commerce, social structures, religious sentiments, family ties, and political interests. And Slaughter's comprehensive work makes clear that the British who chose to go to North America chafed under imperial rule from the start, vigorously disputing many of the colonies' founding charters.</p><p>When the British said the Americans were typically "independent," they meant to disparage them as lawless and disloyal. But the Americans insisted on their moral courage and political principles, and regarded their independence as a great virtue, as they regarded their love of freedom and their loyalty to local institutions. Over the years, their struggles to define this independence took many forms, and Slaughter's compelling narrative takes us from New England and Nova Scotia to New York and Pennsylvania, and south to the Carolinas, as colonists resisted unsympathetic royal governors, smuggled to evade British duties on imported goods (tea was only one of many), and, eventually, began to organize for armed uprisings.</p><p>Britain, especially after its victories over France in the 1750s, was eager to crush these rebellions, but the Americans' opposition only intensified, as did dark conspiracy theories about their enemies&#x2015;whether British, Native American, or French.</p><p>In <i>Independence</i>, Slaughter resets and clarifies the terms in which we may understand this remarkable evolution, showing how and why a critical mass of colonists determined that they could not be both independent and subject to the British Crown. By 1775&#x2013;76, they had become revolutionaries&#x2015;going to war only reluctantly, as a last-ditch means to preserve the independence that they cherished as a birthright.</p></p><p><p><b>Thomas P.

The Venetian explorer Giovanni Caboto, also known as John Cabot, passed that way in the fifteenth century; the English captain Charles Leigh recorded making landfall in 1597 along the Atlantic coast at a place whose first French name acknowledged his discovery, Havre � L&#x2019;Anglois (English Harbor); and Samuel de Champlain at least passed it as he headed south.</p> <p>By the early seventeenth century, the treacherous six-to-eight-week crossings of the Atlantic to these parts had already become part of maritime lore. &#x201c;I have been to Canada seven times,&#x201d; wrote one French captain, &#x201c;and I venture to state that the most favorable of those voyages gave me more white hairs than all those that I have made elsewhere. It is a continual torment for mind and body.&#x201d; Another Frenchman admitted his fear of sailing &#x201c;over the unstable sea, every moment within two fingers of death [<i>� deux doigts de la morte</i>], as the saying goes.&#x201d; He was mindful of the &#x201c;muttering, snorting, whistling, howling, storming, rumbling&#x201d; seas that lifted the ships &#x201c;aloft upon mountains of water, and thence down as it were into the most profound depths of the world.&#x201d; But the French and English kept coming for the fish, furs, land, adventure, independence, and wealth that they imagined awaiting them.</p> <p>French explorers and fur traders founded Port Royal, a post on the Bay of Fundy coast of what we now call Nova Scotia, in 1605. That was less than two years before the first colonists landed at Jamestown, Virginia, establishing the first permanent English settlement in North America, and three years before the French founded another outpost at Quebec. And men from the two nations started fighting almost immediately. Virginia was nine hundred miles away from l&#x2019;Acadie, as the French called their territory, but that was too close, and the continent of North America was too small, at nine million square miles, for the French and English to coexist peacefully. From the early 1600s through the middle of the eighteenth century, the islands and peninsulas of what we now call the Canadian Maritimes&#x2014;New Brunswick, l&#x2019;Acadie (Nova Scotia), Cape Breton Island, �le Saint-Jean (Prince Edward Island), and Placentia (Newfoundland)&#x2014;were a borderland, the front line of conflict between the French and English in the New World.</p> <p>The French abandoned Port Royal in 1607 rather than winter there. It was difficult to recruit traders and trappers, never mind settlers, and its promoters had to agree to some Huguenots (French Protestants) along with the Catholics, who said they would give it another try in 1610. Both groups survived only because the Micmacs suffered their presence, sustained them with trade, and created enduring connections based on intermarriage&#x2014;all on the Indians&#x2019; terms. Beginning in 1611, when the first two Jesuits arrived in New France, there were actually more conflicts between the missionaries and the men at the trading posts than either had with the Indians. During the winter of 1612&#x2013;1613, when no supplies arrived from France, the trappers had to disperse to live with the Micmacs in their hunting camps. In the spring, a French ship removed the troublesome Jesuits and took them down the coast of what is now Maine to Mount Desert Island. There men under the command of Samuel Argall&#x2014;an English pirate who had a commission from the governor of Jamestown to drive out the French&#x2014;attacked and captured the Jesuits, and, in November 1613, with the help of a Jesuit guide, went on to plunder Port Royal. That effectively ended France&#x2019;s first settlement in the New World, but in 1608 the French explorer Samuel de Champlain had founded a settlement he called Quebec, on the St. Lawrence River, and so the French maintained footholds on the North American continent with their scattered outposts even after abandoning Port Royal to the English.</p> <p>The French were colonizing North America at precisely the same time as the English were, and this was no coincidence: They did it to challenge the English and establish Catholic settlements in the face of English Protestant ones, and as one front line in the commercial and military warfare that punctuated the creation of the two empires competing with each other and with the Spanish and Dutch. At its peak in 1712, New France stretched from Newfoundland to the Rocky Mountains, and from Hudson Bay to the Gulf of Mexico, a vast territory divided into five colonies&#x2014;Canada, Acadia, Hudson Bay, Newfoundland, and Louisiana. New France was always sparsely populated and financially modest in comparison to the English colonies on the mainland of North America.</p> <p>In 1629, about seventy Scottish Presbyterians landed at the former Port Royal and established a trading mission. &#x201c;We eat lobsters as big as little children,&#x201d; one of them raved, &#x201c;plenty of salmons and salmon trouts, birds of strange and diverse kinds, hawks of all sorts, doves, turtles, pheasants, partridges, black birds, a kind also of hens, wild turkeys, cranes, herons, infinite store of geese, and three or four kinds of ducks, snipes, cormorants, and many sea fouls, whales, seals, castors [beavers], [and] otters.&#x201d; They, too, got along fine with the ever-flexible Micmac. Nonetheless, the Scottish enterprise failed and, in 1632, an Anglo-French treaty returned l&#x2019;Acadie and Quebec to France.</p> <p>The Micmacs, small bands and family groups rather than a unified tribe, were the principal Indian occupants of what is now Nova Scotia, and apparently they never numbered more than three thousand souls spread over the fifty thousand square miles that included what we now call New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and the southern part of Quebec&#x2019;s Gasp� Peninsula. They ranged in concert with the seasons. January brought them to the seacoast to fish for smelt and cod, and to hunt walruses and seals. In February and March they moved inland to hunt beaver, moose, and bear. From April through October, they were back at the seaside villages, where they gathered shellfish, lobster, crabs, and eels, as well as migratory wildfowl in the spring and fall; between July and September they picked nuts, berries, and dry roots. As winter approached, they broke into smaller units to hunt and fish before beginning the annual cycle again in January.</p> <p>Lines of authority in Micmac bands were vague and variable. Women gathered, cooked, and cared for children, who, unlike those of the European settlers, were not subject to corporal discipline. Men hunted and fished in season, and occasionally waged war on each other, on the Abenaki who lived south of them in what is now Maine, or on the French and English. They were not used to cooperating beyond the level of the band and so battled in small groups with limited aims and without coordinated strategy. They lived in an active spiritual world&#x2014;surrounded by animal and human manitous (spirits), and ever conscious of their individual and collective <i>ginap</i> (spiritual power). Their shamans easily accepted and used Catholic artifacts&#x2014;crosses and rosary beads&#x2014;and adopted Catholic rituals like communion, with its wafers and holy water. The Catholic missionaries tolerated this syncretistic spirituality, realizing they could not expunge native ceremonies and beliefs. When Puritans came to these parts, however, they saw the lives of the Indians around them as being in sharp contrast with their own&#x2014;with their Christian faith and their conflicted relationship to the earthbound world, against which they were at constant war&#x2014;against animals and plants, the native people, even their own inherent natures.</p> <p>Micmac beliefs in the three souls of each being&#x2014;the life soul, brain soul, and free soul&#x2014;prepared them for the trinitarian concepts taught by the Catholic missionaries. They believed that the life soul dies when the body dies, that death of the brain soul leaves one witless, and that the free soul roams in life, in death, and in dreams. Unlike the Puritans, they accepted the natural world as it was, adapting themselves to its demands rather than trying to alter it. They had no interest in visiting Europe, in learning to manufacture the items they purchased or received as gifts from the French and English, or in changing their ways in emulation of them. The French, whom they encountered in smaller numbers than the English, became the Micmacs&#x2019; natural allies; they agreed to pay &#x201c;rent&#x201d; on the land and were more generous gift givers than the impecunious New Englanders.</p> <p>A French ship brought women and children to Port Royal for the first time in 1636, making it a true colony rather than just a trading outpost. These immigrants became the first genuine Acadians. By 1650, the fifty French families who lived, hunted, trapped, farmed, and fished there were developing a distinctive culture bound not only by their shared experiences in the New World but also by kinship. They remained as vulnerable as ever, though, and in 1654, when Oliver Cromwell&#x2019;s government in London commissioned Major Robert Sedgwick, in Boston, to attack New Amsterdam (soon to become New York) as part of its war against the Dutch Republic, Sedgwick seized the opportunity to attack Port Royal instead, even though it had nothing at all to do with the Dutch. Perhaps the best explanation for this unexpected action is that Sedgwick&#x2019;s son-in-law, the future Massachusetts governor Captain John Leverett, had invested in the Maine-Acadia trade, and, as Leverett explained to London officials, the expedition&#x2019;s goal was to enlarge Great Britain&#x2019;s &#x201c;dominions in these western American parts.&#x201d; True enough; any old excuse to invade French settlements furthered the interests of New England traders and their London counterparts.</p> <p>A three-day siege of Port Royal ended in French surrender. The victorious New Englanders seized booty estimated to value �10,000 and captured 220 French soldiers. Boston declared &#x201c;a public and solemn thanksgiving to the Lord for his gracious working.&#x201d; Sedgwick offered Acadians a choice between being shipped back to France with their troops or continuing on their farms &#x201c;unmolested,&#x201d; with &#x201c;liberty of conscience allowed to religion,&#x201d; a concession that reflected the invaders&#x2019; greater interest in commerce than in souls. The Acadians chose to keep their farms in 1654. Under English rule, in comparative isolation and thus independent of France and the Catholic Church, a distinctive Acadian creole culture was beginning to form, an amalgam of Catholic and Huguenot French, Micmac, English, Irish, and even some Spanish influences.</p> <p>Sixteen years later, in 1670, France regained Port Royal in a diplomatic exchange for some British territorial concessions in the West Indies, a bargain that angered New Englanders, who believed they had captured the prize on their own initiative and were safer without a French military presence in Nova Scotia. A high birthrate among Acadians (six to seven children per woman), peaceful relations with the Indians, a generally healthful climate, and an absence of epidemic disease contributed to the colony&#x2019;s growth from about five hundred in 1670 to fifteen hundred by the end of the century.</p> <p>The fortunes of the Micmacs rose and fell with those of the French Acadians, no matter how delicately the Indians approached their diplomacy with the Europeans. The Micmacs were seldom united and could not muster more than eight hundred warriors even if they had acted in concert. Yet they were perceived as a threat by the colonists, as a potential makeweight between the two perennial European enemies and as a genuine force as long as the French and English had only small and scattered outposts that were weakly defended. The Indians continued to mount successful raids on English settlements for another half century, killing eight and capturing fourteen at Dartmouth in 1750, taking scalps outside Halifax in 1756 and 1757, raiding Lunenburg in 1758&#x2014;and making peace only in 1761.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>Joint-stock companies, precursors of modern corporations, played a significant role in the founding of English colonies in North America. Although joint-stock ventures were not new to England in the seventeenth century, the frequency of their creation then and the large size of their financial undertakings in a comparatively poor island nation suggested the grand ambitions England had for empire and trade. The British East India Company, granted a royal charter in 1600 and founded in 1610, was created by London businessmen pooling their resources to enter the Asian spice trade. King James I founded the Plymouth Company in 1606, to minimize the government&#x2019;s risk in establishing colonies in North America. The Virginia Company, which founded Jamestown, was another from the same era. In 1620, the original Plymouth Company was resurrected as the Plymouth Council for New England with forty investors or &#x201c;patentees.&#x201d;</p> <p>The settlers of Plymouth Colony in New England were, technically, employees of the Virginia Company to begin with. About half the original group were Separatists from the Church of England, who had founded their own church, a decision that made them vulnerable to prosecution for treason. They fled first from the village of Scrooby, in Nottinghamshire, then from Boston, in Lincolnshire, and thence to a more tolerant haven in the Netherlands. In Holland they felt culturally alienated and worried about the fate of their children in a foreign land, so they immigrated again, this time to North America. The Pilgrims, as we know them, agreed to pay the Virginia Company for their passage with fish, furs, and lumber that they would harvest when they reached Virginia, but storms blew their ship, the <i>Mayflower</i>, off course and they landed, in 1620, on what is today Cape Cod. There they occupied a Pokanoket Indian village with cleared fields that the Indians had abandoned during a recent devastating epidemic of smallpox. Half of the 102 Pilgrims died during their first winter from hunger, exposure, and disease, but by 1630 the colony had grown to fifteen hundred people and was thriving.</p> <p>A decade after the Plymouth settlement, and at about the same time that women and children first arrived in Port Royal, John Dane, a tailor and one of the early settlers of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, another joint-stock venture, said that he had &#x201c;bent myself to come to New England, thinking that I should be more free here than there from temptations.&#x201d; Dane, like others who made the Atlantic crossing to Massachusetts during the 1630s, fled what they believed to be a diluted religion and a corrupt government, and they founded independent communities based on strict Calvinist principles. They wanted to establish villages of like-minded &#x201c;saints,&#x201d; free of strangers and nonbelievers. This was decidedly not a heterogeneous population that could worship or not as it saw fit: Other dissenters from Anglo-Catholicism (especially Baptists and Quakers), Catholics, Anglicans themselves, and the unchurched had &#x201c;free liberty to keep away from us.&#x201d;</p> <p>Large Puritan migrations in the 1630s brought about fourteen thousand more immigrants, principally from the east coast of England&#x2014;East Anglia, eastern Lincolnshire, eastern Cambridge, and northeast Kent.3 They left a land of martyrs, not just believers: More than 80 percent of the Protestants burned at the stake during the reign of the Catholic Queen Mary (1553&#x2013;1558), daughter of Henry VIII, had come fro...</p></p><h2>Ultimate Spider-Man, Vol. 15: Silver Sable</h2><p>The head of Roxxon Oil sics the world&#39;s greatest mercenary, Silver Sable, on Spider-Man to learn why the web-spinner has targeted Roxxon on his nightly patrols.

Perry&#x2019;s gripping new Charlotte and Thomas Pitt novel invites us back to Victorian London, where greed and ambition never sleep, and passion sometimes runs riot.<br><br> As the nineteenth century draws to a close, most of Europe is in political turmoil, and terrorist threats loom large across the continent. Adding to this unrest is the controversial Sofia Delacruz, who has come to London from Spain to preach a revolutionary gospel of love and forgiveness that many consider blasphemous. Thomas Pitt, commander of Special Branch, is charged with protecting Sofia&#x2014;and shielding Her Majesty&#x2019;s government from any embarrassment that this woman, as beautiful as she is charismatic, might cause.<br><br> When Sofia suddenly vanishes and two of her female disciples are gruesomely murdered, Pitt is challenged as never before. Is Sofia&#x2019;s cousin, wealthy banker Barton Hall, somehow involved? And why has handsome cricket star Dalton Teague insinuated himself into Pitt&#x2019;s investigation? Fearful that this sensational crime may trigger an international incident, Pitt welcomes the help of three allies: his clever wife, Charlotte; her great-aunt, Lady Vespasia; and Victor Narraway, Pitt&#x2019;s friend and former commander at Special Branch. From the narrow streets of Toledo and a lonely monastery high in the hills of Spain, to the halls and wharves of London, Pitt and his friends race against time in their desperate bid to catch a murderer.<br><br> Anne Perry is the acknowledged mistress of Victorian intrigue.

They were standing in a quiet, sunlit room in Whitehall, the traffic outside inaudible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;A Spanish saint?&#x201d; he said, struggling to keep his voice more or less level.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s not Spanish, she&#x2019;s English,&#x201d; Sir Walter replied patiently. &#x201c;She merely lives in Spain. Toledo, I&#x2019;m told. She is here to visit her family.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;And what is this to do with Special Branch, sir?&#x201d; Pitt asked. Special Branch had been created initially to deal with the Irish Problem, and now in the spring of 1898, its remit had broadened greatly to address anything that was considered to be a threat to the security of the nation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All Europe was in turmoil as the century drew toward its close. Unrest was escalating and becoming more open. Anarchist bombings occurred in one place or another every few weeks. In France the Dreyfus affair was raging on toward a climax no one could predict. There were even rumors that the government might fall.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Addressing the threat of assassination to a dignitary visiting England was among the duties of Special Branch&#x2014;but seeing to the needs of a touring nun, or whatever she was, was certainly not. Pitt opened his mouth to point this out, but Sir Walter spoke first.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;There have been letters containing threats against her life,&#x201d; Sir Walter said, his face completely expressionless. &#x201c;Her opinions have caused some concern and&nbsp;. . . anger. Unfortunately she has been rather too free in expressing them.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a police problem,&#x201d; Pitt said tersely. &#x201c;I doubt anyone here will care enough to argue with her, let alone cause a nuisance. But if they do, then the local police can take care of it.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sir Walter sighed, as if this was a tedious argument. &#x201c;Pitt, this is not a suggestion. You may think that many people are apathetic as to the exact details of religious doctrine, and only deeply committed Christians will argue with her&#x2014;and even if they do, you trust that they at least know how to behave within the law.&#x201d; He raised white eyebrows. &#x201c;If so, you are a fool. Some men will argue more passionately about religion than anything else on earth. To many, religion represents order, sanity, the inevitable victory of good over evil. It confirms to them their place in creation.&#x201d; He smiled bleakly. &#x201c;Somewhere near the top. The appearance of modesty forbids the very top. Something has to be held back for God.&#x201d; His smile faded and his eyes were grim. &#x201c;But say something to threaten that place near the top, and you threaten everything.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He shook his head. &#x201c;For God&#x2019;s sake, man, look at how religion has torn us apart throughout history. Start with the Crusades, and the Inquisition in Spain, the persecution of the Cathars and Waldenses in the rest of Europe, the massacres of the Huguenots in France. We&#x2019;ve burned both Catholics and Protestants ourselves. You think it couldn&#x2019;t happen again? If Dreyfus were not a Jew, do you think this whole monstrous affair would ever have started, never mind reached this proportion?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pitt drew breath to argue, and found the words frozen on his tongue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was barely the end of April. Earlier in the month President McKinley had asked the U.S. Congress for a declaration of war against Spain. Cuba had been seeking independence from Spain for many years, and the United States had begun to intervene in the dispute, seeing an opportunity to gain power and position. When the battleship USS <i>Maine</i> had been mysteriously blown up in Havana harbor, the powerful U.S. press openly blamed Spain. On 21 April Congress had ordered a naval blockade of all Cuban harbors, demanding that Spain surrender control of Cuba. On 25 April, four days ago, America had declared war. It was the first time they had done such a thing in their brief, idealistic existence. They had focused on internal expansion, had settled the land, built, explored and developed industry. Now suddenly the country was increasing the size of its armies and its navy and looking for possessions overseas, as far away as Hawaii and the Philippines.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This new desire for outward expansion could grow to involve other naval powers, even Britain, if America chose to make it so. If anything went wrong with this Spanish woman&#x2019;s visit, it could easily be misconstrued by Spain. A chilling thought given the state of affairs across Europe. President Carnot of France had been assassinated four years ago. Last year it had been Prime Minister C�novas del Castillo in Spain, where the violence had reached new abominations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;She is bringing half a dozen or so of her&nbsp;. . . acolytes,&#x201d; Sir Walter went on, as if he had not noticed Pitt&#x2019;s absence of attention.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;God only knows what sort of people they are, but we don&#x2019;t want any of them killed on our soil. I&#x2019;m sure you understand the embarrassment that would be to Her Majesty&#x2019;s Government. Especially in light of our history with Spain. We don&#x2019;t want to give them any excuses for war with us as well.&#x201d; He looked at Pitt carefully, as if possibly he had overestimated him and would be obliged to reconsider his opinion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir,&#x201d; Pitt replied. &#x201c;Of course I understand. Is it even remotely likely that she would be attacked here?&#x201d; He asked the question not in a spirit of incredulity, but hoping for some assurance that it was not so.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sir Walter&#x2019;s expression eased a little, the deep lines about his mouth less severe. &#x201c;Probably not,&#x201d; he replied with the ghost of a smile. &#x201c;But apparently this woman&#x2019;s English family do not approve of her at all. She left in the first place over some quarrel of principle, so I hear. Families can be the devil!&#x201d; There was some sympathy in his voice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pitt made a last effort to avoid the task. &#x201c;I would point out that domestic violence is also police work, sir, not Special Branch&#x2019;s. We have a big case of industrial sabotage at the moment that looks as if it is foreign inspired. It&#x2019;s getting worse and has to be stopped.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sir Walter&#x2019;s eyes were bright and sharp. &#x201c;I am well aware of Special Branch&#x2019;s concerns. I will remind you that it is the effect on the nation that determines whose problem it is, Pitt, and you know that as well as I do. If you didn&#x2019;t, believe me, you would not be long in your position.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pitt cleared his throat, and spoke quietly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Do we know the nature of this quarrel within the woman&#x2019;s family, sir?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sir Walter gave a slight shrug. If he noticed the change in Pitt&#x2019;s tone, he was sophisticated enough not to show it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;The usual sort of thing with willful daughters, I believe,&#x201d; he replied, the smile back on his face. &#x201c;She declined to marry the young man of excellent breeding and fortune, and tedious habits, whom they had selected for her.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pitt remembered that Sir Walter had three daughters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;And ran off to Spain and married some Spanish man of unknown character and probably unknown ancestry, at least to Sofia&#x2019;s parents,&#x201d; Sir Walter added. &#x201c;I imagine it was embarrassing to them.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;How long ago was this?&#x201d; Pitt asked, keeping his face as expressionless as he could. His own daughter, Jemima, was fast approaching marriageable age. He didn&#x2019;t like to think about it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, it has been some time,&#x201d; Sir Walter replied ruefully. &#x201c;I think it is her religious views that have now compounded the problem. It wouldn&#x2019;t matter so much if she kept them to herself. But she has formed something of a sect. Has her acolytes, as I mentioned.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Roman Catholic?&#x201d; Pitt imagined a cult to do with the Virgin Mary, perhaps, causing old persecutions to be remembered.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Apparently not.&#x201d; Sir Walter lifted one elegant shoulder. &#x201c;It hardly matters. Just see that no one attacks her while she is in England. The sooner she leaves the better, but alive and well, if you please.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pitt straightened to attention. &#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Sofia Delacruz?&#x201d; Charlotte said with a sudden sharpening of interest. She and Pitt were sitting by a low fire in the parlor, the curtains drawn across the French windows onto the garden. Almost all the light was gone from the cool spring sky and there was a definite chill in the air. Sixteen-year-old Jemima and thirteen-year-old Daniel were both upstairs in their rooms. Jemima would be daydreaming, or writing letters to her friends. Daniel would be deep in the adventures of the latest <i>Boy&#x2019;s Own Paper.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pitt leaned forward and put another log on the fire. It gave less heat than coal, but he liked the smell of the apple wood.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Have you heard of her?&#x201d; he asked with surprise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Charlotte smiled slightly self-consciously. &#x201c;Yes, a bit.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He remembered Sir Walter&#x2019;s reference to a scandal in the past; he knew how Charlotte loathed gossip, even when it was the lifeblood of investigation. She listened to it, but with guilt, and a thread of fear. She had seen too many of its victims firsthand to take pleasure in it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What did you hear?&#x201d; he said gravely. &#x201c;She may be in danger. I need to know.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Charlotte did not argue, which in itself was indicative of a different kind of interest. He detected concern in her eyes. She put down the sewing she had been doing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You are going to protect her?&#x201d; she asked curiously.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve assigned Brundage to it,&#x201d; he replied.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Not Stoker?&#x201d; She was puzzled.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Stoker&#x2019;s quite senior now,&#x201d; he pointed out. He did not want to be sharp and set a division between them. This quiet evening alone with her was the best part of his day. Its peace mattered intensely to him. &#x201c;He has other responsibilities. Brundage is a good man.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard Sofia&#x2019;s ideas are pretty radical.&#x201d; She was gazing at him steadily.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;For example?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; she admitted, pushing the sewing away entirely and leaning forward a little. &#x201c;Perhaps I&#x2019;ll go and listen to what she has to say when she arrives. She has to have more fire than our local minister.&#x201d; Charlotte went to church on most Sundays because she took the children. It was a natural part of belonging to the community and of being accepted. It was also the best place for Jemima and Daniel to meet other youths whose families Charlotte knew in a somewhat substantial way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>More often than not, Pitt discovered some pressing duty elsewhere on Sundays.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pitt nodded agreement, but he was far more conscious of a sharp memory stirring in his mind. His mother had taken him to the parish church on the edge of the estate every Sunday of his childhood. He could still picture the shafts of colored light slanting downward from the stained-glass windows; smell the stone and faint odor of dust. There were shuffles of movement, a creaking of stays, and the dry riffle of pages being turned. Very seldom had he actually listened to the sermons. Some of the stories from the Old Testament were good, but they were isolated, forming no consistent history of God and man. To him the Bible seemed to be more a series of errors and corrections, well-earned disasters and then heroic rescues. A lot of the rest of it was lists of names, or wonderfully poetic prophecies of desolation to come.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Had he believed any of it? And even if he had, did it matter? If he were honest, the stories from his borrowed copies of <i>The Boy&#x2019;s Own Paper</i> had stirred his heart far more, with their tales of adventure, of heroes any boy would want to copy. He smiled now with quiet pleasure; he felt a sense of identity with his son when he saw Daniel reading. The magazine now had a new name, the stories had different settings, but the spirit was the same.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So what was it that still clung to him so sharply about those old memories of church? The companionship of his mother, the rare sense of peace within her when she was there, as if she were at last safe, loved and completely unafraid? He had thought at the time that her faith was simple and certain. While he was glad for her, because he knew it comforted some of her fears that he could not, he had no desire to be the same way. It was a subject they had never spoken about, out of choice on both of their parts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He wondered now if perhaps it had not been nearly as easy for her to keep faith as he had supposed, that she had led him to think it was because it took a certain burden from him. It was one area in which he could be a child. She had allowed him that, as she had so many other things of which he had been unaware at the time. She had died without ever telling him she was ill. She had sent him away so he would not notice, not suffer with her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Charlotte was watching him, waiting. Was she aware of the thoughts inside him?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You truly want to go and listen to her?&#x201d; Pitt said, breaking the silence at last.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she said immediately. &#x201c;As I said, I&#x2019;ve heard she is outrageous, even blasphemous in her ideas. I&#x2019;d love to know what they are.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He realized how little he and Charlotte had ever spoken of their beliefs when it came to matters of religion. And yet he knew everything else about her. He knew what hurt her, made her angry, and made her laugh or cry, who she liked and what she thought of them, and what she thought of herself. Often he would read her emotions by her expression. At other times it was in far smaller things: a sudden silence, an unexplained kindness, the letting slip an old grudge someone else could have held on to, and through these small actions he knew she had understood a shadow, or a pain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Does it matter to you?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;If she is blasphemous.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She looked at him with surprise. At first he thought it was because he had asked. Then he realized that she was surprised to not have a ready answer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I have no idea,&#x201d; she confessed. &#x201c;Perhaps that is why I want to go. I&#x2019;m not sure I even know what blasphemy is. Cursing, or the desecration of a shrine, I understand. But what is an idea that is blasphemous?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Darwin&#x2019;s <i>On the Origin of Species,</i>&#x201d; he answered immediately. &#x201c;The suggestion that we evolved from something lesser rather than descended from something greater. It threatens our entire concept of ourselves.&#x201d; He smiled ruefully.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, if that is what she has come to talk about, she is a little late to cause trouble with it,&#x201d; Charlotte said drily. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been fighting about that one already for the last thirty some years! It isn&#x2019;t even interesting anymore.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;So you&#x2019;re not coming, then?&#x201d; He tried to keep his face straight, as if he were not deliberately teasing her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course I&#x2019;m coming!&#x201d; she said instantly, then realized what he was doing and smiled. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never seen a woman blasphemer. Do you suppose there will be a riot?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He did not satisfy her by answering.</p>...</p><h2>Words of Radiance: The Stormlight Archive Book Two</h2><p>From the bestselling author who completed Robert Jordan&#39;s epic WHEEL OF TIME series comes a new, original creation that matches anything else in modern fantasy for epic scope, thrilling imagination, superb characters and sheer addictiveness. Return to a planet swept by apocalyptic storms, a world tipping into war as aristocratic families move to control the shard blades and shard plates, ancient artifacts from a past civilisation that can win wars. As the world tips into a war for control of the mythical artifacts of power made from Shard, characters are swept up into new dangers which will threaten their integrity and their lives. Huge, ideas-filled, world-spanning fantasy from a master of the genre.</p><p>Brandon Sanderson was born in Nebraska in 1975.

Read his blogs at http://mistborn.blogspot.co.uk andhttp://mistborn.livejournal.com.*Starred Review* The readers of Sanderson&#x2019;s The Way of Kings (2010) may have been waiting for him to return to the Stormlight Archives from his labors in finishing the late Robert Jordan&#x2019;s epic Wheel of Time. The wait is now over, and devoted followers of fantasy on the grandest imaginable scale can make themselves comfortable and start reading. The world of Roshar is still very close to being a character in its own right (one thinks of Dune), as Sanderson has used the room afforded by a book of this size to build it in loving detail, including the fierce storms that make civilized life difficult even in peacetime. But the humans and the humanoid Parshendi are still fighting, although Brightlord Kholin is leading an army deep into enemy territory. His sister, Jasnah, is with him, seeking a legendary lost city that her student, Shallan, believes may hold the key to victory. Far below the level of the high command, the rising young slave warrior, Kaladin, learns that the Parshendi have a counterstrategy in preparation, one that portends the destruction of the world unless he can become the founder of a new order of the legendary Knights Radiant. Many readers will find Shallan and Kaladin the most absorbing of the major characters because they have the most to lose, but the characterization is on the whole as meticulous as the world-building. A very impressive continuation. --Roland Green</p><h2>Nuclides and Isotopes : Chart of the Nuclides 17th Edition</h2><p>Description: This product consists of a 100-page soft cover book that describes the history of the development of the periodic table and earlier charts of the nuclides, detailed explanations of the information presented on the chart, discussions of trends in stability of the nuclides on the chart, unit conversion factors, and fundamental physics constants.

Transparency: We have the right to know how our food is produced.<br>2. Fairness: Producing food should not impose costs on others.<br>3. Humanity: Inflicting unnecessary suffering on animals is wrong.<br>4. Social Responsibility: Workers are entitled to decent wages and working conditions.<br>5. Needs: Preserving life and health justifies more than other desires.<br><br>Peter Singer, the groundbreaking ethicist who "may be the most controversial philosopher alive" (<i>The New Yorker</i>), now sets his critical sights on the food we buy and eat: where it comes from, how it's produced, and whether it was raised humanely. Teaming up once again with attorney Jim Mason, his coauthor on the acclaimed Animal Factories, Singer explores the impact our food choices have on humans, animals, and the environment.<br><br>In <i>The Way We Eat</i>, Singer and Mason examine the eating habits of three American families with very different diets. They track down the sources of each family's food to probe the ethical issues involved in its production and marketing. What kinds of meat are most humane to eat? Is "organic" always better? Wild fish or farmed? Recognizing that not all of us will become vegetarians, Singer and Mason offer ways to make the best food choices. As they point out: "You can be ethical without being fanatical."</p><p>PETER SINGER, is author of <i>Animal Liberation</i> and coauthor of <i>Animal Factories</i>, is one of the highest-profile writers on ethics today, regularly drawing fire for his views on such hot-button issues as abortion, euthanasia, war, and animal rights.

He lives on Virginia's EasternIf Rick Adamson ranted and raved his way through this treatise on the ethical and economic repercussions of eating animals, it would be easy to ignore. But he delivers it so objectively that he gives the issue even more gravitas. This work, by a Princeton ethicist and an animal rights activist and writer, demonstrates why Americans should take a hard look at the food they eat. Even if it were possible to ignore the facts of factory farming's cruelty to animals, the listener can't ignore the environmental and economic impact of food production. It's also a good handbook for conscientious shoppers trying to figure out labels like "certified humane," "fair trade," and others. This book could change your life. M.S. � AudioFile 2006, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>Pompeii: From the Sunday Times bestselling author</h2><p>A sweltering week in late August. Where better to enjoy the last days of summer than on the beautiful Bay of Naples? But even as Rome&#39;s richest citizens relax in their villas around Pompeii and Herculaneum, there are ominous warnings that something is going wrong. Wells and springs are failing, a man has disappeared, and now the greatest aqueduct in the world - the mighty Aqua Augusta - has suddenly ceased to flow. Through the eyes of four characters - a young engineer, an adolescent girl, a corrupt millionaire and an elderly scientist - Robert Harris brilliantly recreates a luxurious world on the brink of destruction.</p><p>Certain thriller writers burst upon the scene with considerable impact: Forsyth with <i>The Day of the Jackal</i>, Cruz Smith with <i>Gorky Park</i> and Robert Harris with the masterly <i>Fatherland</i>. Interestingly, of these three authors, by far the most consistent has been Harris, and his new novel, <i>Pompeii</i> is in some ways his most audacious offering yet, a brilliantly orchestrated thriller-cum-historical recreation that plays outrageous tricks with the reader's expectations.<p> As in the equally adroit <i>Enigma</i>, Harris takes a familiar historical event (there, the celebrated code-breakers at Bletchley Park, here the volcanic obliteration of an Italian city in AD79) and seamlessly weaves a characteristically labyrinthine plot in and around the existing facts. But that's not all he does here: few novelists who (unlike Harris) make a speciality of ancient history for their setting pull off the sense of period quite as impressively as the author does here. As the famous catastrophe approaches, we are pleasurably immersed in the sights, sounds and smells of the Ancient World, each detail conjured with jaw-dropping verisimilitude.</p><p> Harris's protagonist is the engineer Marcus Attilius, placed in charge of the massive aqueduct that services the teeming masses living in and around the Bay of Naples. Despite the pride he takes in his job, Marcus has pressing concerns: his predecessor in the job has mysteriously vanished, and another task is handed to Marcus by the scholar Pliny: he is to undertake crucial repairs to the aqueduct near Pompeii, the city in the shadow of the restless Mount Vesuvius. And as Marcus faces several problems--all life threatening--an event approaches that will make all his concerns seem petty.</p><p> Other writers have placed narratives in the shadow of this most famous of volcanic cataclysms, but Harris triumphantly ensures that his characters' individual dramas are not dwarfed by implacable nature; Marcus is a vividly drawn hero: complex, conflicted and a canny synthesis of modern and ancient mindsets. Some may wish that Harris might return to something closer to our time in his next novel, but few who take this trip into a dangerous past will be able to resist Harris's spellbinding historical saga. --<i>Barry Forshaw</i></p>"Blazingly exciting... Harris, as Vesuvius explodes, gives full vent to his genius for thrilling narrative... pulse-rate-speeding masterpieces of suffocating suspense and searing action" (<i>Sunday Times</i>)<br><br>"Robert Harris's <i>Pompeii</i> is his best yet: as explosive as Etna, as addictive as a thriller, as satisfying as great history - Simon Sebag Montefiore 'Books of the Year'" (<i>Daily Telegraph</i>)<br><br>"Breakneck pace, constant jeopardy and subtle twists of plot... a blazing blockbuster" (<i>Daily Mail</i>)<br><br>"Harris has done a tremendous job in evoking life in ancient Italy...

Unfortunately, one cold January morning, trouble comes to him. When Brady lets his dog out into the backyard of his Back Bay brownstone, he finds a girl buried under the snow in Brady's back yard. A teenager, maybe fifteen or sixteen, who had apparently crawled into the backyard, bleeding, in the middle of the night, only to die from hypothermia and blood loss. The singular clue to her identity is a small piece of paper with the brownstone's address scribbled on it.<br>Now Brady is determined to find out who the girl was, why she had his address, and what happened to her. But the mysterious girl's death is only the beginning - someone out there knows Brady is trying to find out what happened that night and is willing to do anything, or kill anyone, to keep the truth from coming out.</p><p>William G.

She left on Sunday afternoon for a week-long gathering of hospital administrators at some conference center in Scottsdale, Arizona, with the word "Rancho" in its name. She wouldn't be back until next Sunday night.</p><p>She'd been promoted back in the summer. New title, big raise. Her new responsibilities included attending conferences and drinking margaritas with her counterparts from other hospitals. She called it "networking" and claimed it was a key element in her job description.</p><p>As near as I could tell, hospital administrators were obsessed with finding ways to save money. Evie had a word for that, too. "Streamlining," she called it.</p><p>I told her it looked to me like they were mainly interested in finding ways to justify cutting staff and reducing services to patients.</p><p>She said that was unfair. Efficiency, she said. That's what streamlining meant. Finding ways to deliver the same services at lower cost. In fact, she said, the way she saw her job, it was all about finding ways to avoid cutting services in times of skyrocketing medical costs.</p><p>I could have gone to Arizona with her. She claimed she wanted me to. Some of her fellow hospital administrators were bringing their spouses, and so what if, technically, I was not Evie's spouse.</p><p>"Virtual spouse," we called each other. Close enough.</p><p>I told her I didn't like it out there. There was no water in Scottsdale, Arizona. A place without water has no fish, and a place with no fish is not my kind of place.</p><p>"You could get away from this horrible winter," she said, and when she put it that way, the idea was tempting. The sun hadn't shone on Boston since the arrival of the new year two weeks earlier, just day after depressing dark day of cold gray grunge, with frequent doses of rain, or sleet, or snow, or some miserable combination of all three.</p><p>"What would I do while you're busy conferring?" I said.</p><p>"Sit by the pool, drink mai tais, ogle the girls in bikinis," she said. "Play golf."</p><p>"I gave up golf and ogling many years ago," I said. "Too stressful."</p><p>"You used to ogle me."</p><p>"Still do," I said. "That's different."</p><p>"Well," she said, "you could just relax and get away from the office for a few days and be with me. We never go anywhere anymore."</p><p>I arched my eyebrows. "A conference for hospital administrators? In the middle of the desert?"</p><p>She smiled. "Point taken. Maybe this summer we can go somewhere, though, huh?"</p><p>I agreed to that and began thinking about Montana and British Columbia and Alaska and other watery, trout-filled destinations that Evie might like.</p><p>Meanwhile, though, she was out there in sunny Arizona, and I was here in wintry Boston.</p><p>I shut off the alarm, yawned, and stretched. Henry yawned and stretched, too. Then he slithered off the bed and trotted into the hallway. I considered rolling over and going back to sleep. Except I had a job, a Tuesday full of obligations, and a secretary who'd make my life miserable if I was late to the office. So I slid out of bed, pulled on a T-shirt and a pair of sweatpants, and staggered into the bathroom, where I peed and splashed water on my face.</p><p>When I came out, Henry was sitting at the top of the stairs with his ears cocked and that particular expectant look on his face that meant he needed to go outside.</p><p>So he and I padded downstairs. I opened the back door, and Henry waded out into the three or four inches of last night's new white snow that had fallen on top of the two feet of old grimy snow in our walled-in backyard garden on Beacon Hill.</p><p>While Henry did his business and played in the snow out back, I switched on the electric coffeepot in the kitchen and went back upstairs. I showered, shaved, selected the day's office pinstripe, and got dressed except for the necktie and jacket.</p><p>Back downstairs, I poured a mug of coffee, made Henry's breakfast, then opened the back door to let him in. In all seasons except winter, Evie and I joined Henry in the garden with our morning coffee. We sat at the picnic table, watched the birds flock at the feeders, and sipped our coffee. We didn't say much. Neither of us was a morning person.</p><p>Henry was definitely a morning dog, however, and he liked hanging out in the garden twelve months a year, even in the dark depressing doldrums of midwinter. Usually when I opened the door he'd be standing there on the stoop with his stubby tail all awag in anticipation of breakfast.</p><p>On this Tuesday morning in January, though, he wasn't on the stoop. Henry was orange and white, mostly white, and it took me a minute to spot him in the shadows against the snow. He was near the high brick wall that separated our garden from the back alley. He had his butt up in the air, and he was growling and whining and poking at a mound of snow with his nose.</p><p>"Hey," I said. "Your food's ready. Come and get it."</p><p>I noticed that the gate--the door in the wall that opened out onto the back alley--was half open. The lock was broken, and it must have come unlatched. Last night's wind had blown it open, and the snow had come swirling in and drifted around it.</p><p>Henry was ignoring me.</p><p>"Henry," I yelled, "for crissake get in the house. Let's go. It's too cold to stand here yelling at you."</p><p>He kept whining and growling and poking his nose into the snow. This was odd. Henry was usually pretty obedient.</p><p>"If I have to put on my boots and slog out there in the snow and drag you inside," I said, "you can forget about breakfast."</p><p>The word "breakfast" got his attention. He lifted his head, turned, and looked at me.</p><p>"Come on." I clapped my hands. "Right now, dammit. I'm serious."</p><p>Henry pondered his options, then resumed growling and poking around in the snow.</p><p>And just about then the snow-covered mound in the shadow of the back wall of my garden began to assume a recognizable shape.</p><p>I muttered, "Oh, shit," pulled on my Bean boots, and plowed through the snow to where Henry was nosing around. I grabbed his collar and hauled him away. Then I pressed my nose close to his, stared him in the eyes, and said, "Get in the house. Now. I mean it."</p><p>He took a look at me and saw that I did, in fact, mean it. So he shrugged and headed for the back door.</p><p>I knelt down and brushed the snow off the mound beside the garden wall. It was, as I'd feared and suspected, a body. A human body.</p><p>I couldn't tell if he was old or young, black or white, rich or poor. I couldn't tell whether he was alive or dead. He was curled fetally on his side facing the wall with his knees pulled up to his chest and his arms hugging himself and his hands jammed into his armpits. He wore a black knit hat pulled tight over his head, a dark blue wool topcoat, sneakers, jeans.</p><p>I got one arm under his knees the other under his shoulders, hugged him against my chest, and lifted him. He was small and not very heavy. He hung limp in my arms.</p><p>When his head lolled back, I saw his face. It was a young face with smooth, unwrinkled skin. Not a man. A young woman. A teenager, I guessed. Just a kid.</p><p>Her skin was gray. Her lips were blue. Her eyes were half-lidded, and her mouth was open. I could detect no movement whatsoever in her body or around her mouth and nose that would suggest she was breathing.</p><p>I hugged her tight, stood up, and plowed back through the snow to the house. I pushed the back door open with my hip, squeezed in sideways through the doorway, and lugged the girl into the living room. I laid her on the sofa, opened up the crocheted afghan that Evie kept folded over the back, and spread it over her.</p><p>Henry was right on my heels. He sat down on the floor next to the sofa, looking at the girl.</p><p>I touched her face. It felt cold and clammy, like the skin of a freshly caught trout.</p><p>The bottom halves of her eyes under her half-closed lids looked dull.</p><p>I pressed my finger under her jawbone. I could find no pulse. No sign of life. No movement. Nothing.</p><p>I went to the kitchen for the cordless phone.</p><p>I hit 911 on my way back to the living room. When the dispatcher answered, I told her my name and where I lived and said I'd found a young woman in my backyard. I explained that when I found her, she was covered with last night's snow. She had to have been out there for several hours to get covered with snow. I couldn't find a pulse, she didn't seem to be breathing, and her skin was cold and clammy and kind of grayish, and--</p><p>"Take it easy," the dispatcher said. "Somebody will be right there."</p><p>I said I was afraid the girl was dead, but I wasn't sure.</p><p>"Cover her with a blanket."</p><p>"I did that already. Is there anything else I can do?"</p><p>"No. Just keep her warm. What's the victim's name?"</p><p>"I don't know. I never saw her before. She must've come into my backyard in the nighttime, looking for a place to curl up, get out of the cold, and--"</p><p>"Right," she said. "You sit tight, Mr. Coyne. Don't do anything. The EMTs will be right along."</p><p>Then she disconnected.</p><p>I put the phone on the coffee table and stood there, looking down at the girl. She was small, barely over five feet tall. Blond curls stuck out under the edges of her knit cap. She had a little rosebud mouth and a slightly upturned nose. I noticed that she wore a stud with a tiny green stone in the crease alongside her nose. It looked like jade.</p><p>I figured she was a runaway. Who besides a runaway would slip into somebody's backyard looking for a place to get out of the weather on a winter night?</p><p>Her arm was hanging off the sofa. I picked it up and folded it over her chest. I laid my hand on top of hers. It felt cold and still and lifeless.</p><p>I studied her motionless face. She was terribly young. Fifteen or sixteen, I guessed. Just a kid.</p><p>I wondered if she'd called for help, knocked at my door in the nighttime wanting to be let in out of the cold.</p><p>I would have heard her, wouldn't I? Surely Henry would have gone racing downstairs, barking. Wouldn't he?</p><p>Could I have saved this girl's life?</p><p>"Who are you?" I said. "What happened to you? Why aren't you home with Mommy and Daddy? Why did you come crawling into my garden?"</p><p>And then I said, "Please don't be dead."</p><p></p><p>Two EMTs came banging on my front door six or eight minutes after I called. One of them had sandy hair. The other was older, Hispanic, with a thin black mustache. They were grumbling about the ice and snow. Mt. Vernon Street hadn't been plowed yet this morning. They said they almost didn't make it up the hill. They seemed to be implying that it was my fault.</p><p>I showed them where the girl was lying on my sofa. They bent over her. The Hispanic guy took her pulse and peeled back the afghan and listened to her chest with a stethoscope. The other EMT strapped an oxygen mask over her mouth and nose.</p><p>"Oxygen," I said. "She's alive?"</p><p>The Hispanic looked up at me. "You didn't tell the dispatcher she was bleeding."</p><p>"Bleeding? I didn't know..."</p><p>"It's dried on her pants," he said. "Coagulated. The cold does that. There was a lot of bleeding."</p><p>"Was," I said.</p><p>"It's mostly stopped."</p><p>"So is she--"</p><p>But he'd returned his attention to the girl. They were ignoring me, doing their job.</p><p>The Hispanic guy said something, and the blond EMT nodded, straightened up, and went outside. He came hustling back a minute later pushing a collapsible gurney. The two of them slid a board under the girl, strapped her on, stabilized her head, and lifted her onto the gurney. Their movements were efficient and coordinated. They made a good team. They'd done this before. They knew what they were doing. It was comforting.</p><p>They wheeled her out the front door, down the steps, and lifted her into the emergency wagon. They moved fast and efficiently, and that gave me hope. I figured, if the girl was dead, the EMTs would have no reason to hurry.</p><p>She was still wrapped in Evie's crocheted afghan. I followed behind them and watched from my front steps.</p><p>The blond EMT climbed in back with the girl. The Hispanic guy slammed the door shut and sprinted around to the driver's side. The wagon's motor had been left running. He turned on the siren, and a minute later they went skidding and slewing up unplowed Mt. Vernon Street.</p><p>I stood there on my front steps until the wagon disappeared over the crest of the hill and the siren faded in the distance. Henry had wandered out, and he sat on the steps beside me.</p><p>I kept thinking: She'd been bleeding, and I hadn't noticed. The EMT said it had "mostly" stopped. Meaning not entirely. Meaning, maybe, if I'd noticed she was bleeding when I first found her and had told the 911 dispatcher, there might have been something I could have done.</p><p>Instead, I'd assumed she was dead. She seemed lifeless. No pulse that I could detect. No movement. She'd spent a cold January night curled up in the snow in my backyard. How could she not be dead?</p><p>I hadn't thought to ask them where they were taking her. I clung to the desperate, probably irrational hope that she'd survive in spite of the fact that I'd screwed up.</p><p></p><p>I poured myself some coffee and sat at the kitchen table, warming my hands on the mug. It had all happened so fast, and it was so unexpected and shocking, that it didn't quite seem real.</p><p>What had made her bleed? Where was the blood coming from? Had she been stabbed? Or shot?</p><p>And why was she in the alley out back in the first place? What brought her into my yard? Was my garden door the only one that had blown open? Did she wander into my backyard to find shelter? Was it as simple and random as that?</p><p>Maybe somebody dumped her there.</p><p>I didn't think I'd ever forget her face. It was a sweet, young, innocent face, the face of a girl, not quite yet a woman, with her whole life still to be lived.</p><p>I wondered who she was--whose daughter and granddaughter, whose sister and niece and cousin and best friend and team-mate and girlfriend. A runaway, I assumed. There were a lot of runaway teenagers in Boston. But they all had run away from somewhere.</p><p>And I couldn't stop wondering...if I had found her sooner, if I had noticed that she was bleeding?...</p><p>I pulled on my boots, went out into my yard, and went over to the place by the back wall where I'd found her. I could see the faint dimples of her footprints in the snow where she'd come in. A couple inches of snow had fallen on them. They were close together, as if she'd been walking slowly and with some difficulty.</p><p>In the hollowed-out compressed place where she'd lain, I saw the stain of old blood. There wasn't much of it, just a patch a little smaller than a tea saucer, but it was unmistakable. It was dark brown, almost black where it had seeped into the snow.</p><p>If I'd noticed this stain when I'd picked her up, and if I'd recognized it for what I was, I might have been able to save her life.</p><p>I tried to tell myself I'd done my best, but I wasn't convinced.</p><p>I took another look around the yard, but I noticed nothing that would tell me anything else about the girl. Just those faint snow-covered footprints coming in through the gate and the bloodstained place where she'd huddled for the night, dying in my backyard while I slept.</p><p>OUT COLD Copyright 2006 by William G.

Joe Grey and his friends pounce on three investigations that may connect to one larger mystery&#x2014;including one case that is very personal&#x2014;in this hair-raising installment in Shirley Rousseau Murphy&#x2019;s beloved, award-winning series.</strong></p><p>Joe Grey and his partner, Dulcie, are frantic when Courtney, their pretty teen-kitten goes missing. Aided by their two- and four-legged friends, they hit the streets of Molina Point in search of their calico girl. Has Joe Grey and Dulcie&#x2019;s only daughter been lured away by someone and stolen? Is she lying somewhere hurt, or worse?</p><p>Courtney has no idea that everyone is desperately looking for her. Locked in an upstairs apartment above the local antiques shop, she&#x2019;s enjoying her first solo adventure. When she first met Ulrich Seaver, the shop&#x2019;s owner, Courtney was frightened. But the human has coddled and pampered her, winning her trust. Sheltered by her parents, her brothers, and her kind human companions, the innocent Courtney is unaware of how deceptive strangers can be. She doesn&#x2019;t know that Ulrich is hiding a dangerous secret that could threaten her and everyone in this charming California coastal village.</p><p>With his focus on finding Courtney, Joe Grey has neglected his detective work with the Molina Point Police Department. Before his daughter disappeared, Joe found a viciously beaten woman lying near the beach. Now the police investigation has stalled, and the clever feline worries his human colleagues may have missed a vital clue. Joe is also concerned about a family of newcomers whose domestic battles are disturbing the town&#x2019;s tranquility. Loud and abrasive, the Luthers&#x2019; angry arguing, shouting, and swearing in the early hours of the night have neighbors on edge and the cops on alert. One of the couple&#x2019;s late-night shouting matches masked the sounds of a burglary, and now a criminal is on the loose.</p><p>Though the crimes are as crisscrossed as the strands of a ball of yarn, Joe Grey&#x2019;s cat senses tell him they may somehow be linked. It&#x2019;s up to the fleet-footed feline and his crime-solving coterie to untangle the mysteries before it&#x2019;s too late.</p></p><p><p>Shirley Rousseau Murphy is the author of twenty mysteries in the Joe Grey series, for which she has won the Cat Writers&#x2019; Association Muse Medallion nine years running, and has received ten national Cat Writers&#x2019; Association Awards for best novel of the year.

He lives in Cedar City, Utah.Instead of resuming the adventures of Alcius, the fourth volume of the Corean Chronicles adopts the points of view of Dainyl, an Alector, and Mykel, one of his talented (and Talented--i.e., psychic) company captains. As previous chronicles (<i>Legacies</i>, 2002; <i>Darknesses</i>, 2003; <i>Scepters</i>, 2004) have imparted, Corus has been developed as a future home for aliens who live by draining one planet's biological life force before moving to another. The development is supervised by Alectors, bigger, stronger, technologically superior to the natives, and all possessed of Talent, which most natives lack. The aliens' transfer to Corus is imminent, but the highest-ranked Alectors are intriguing among themselves, making use of the natives' political and economic aspirations. Dainyl, a just-promoted Alector, is supposed to straighten out a revolt among the steers, as the natives are derisively called. He discovers that higher-up Alectors instigated it, and the rarely seen aboriginal inhabitants of the planet, the Soarers, have gotten involved. Readers of its predecessors may most relish this book, which does, however, stand on its own. <i>Frieda Murray</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Meanwhile, the British Empire was in decline but did not yet know it. Any number of other powers might have won primacy in the twentieth century and beyond, including Germany, Russia, possibly even France. Yet the coming century was to belong to the English-speaking peoples, who successively and successfully fought the Kaiser's Germany, Axis aggression and Soviet Communism, and who are now struggling against Islamic fundamentalist terrorism.</p><p>Andrew Roberts brilliantly reveals what made the English-speaking people the preeminent political culture since 1900, and how they have defended their primacy from the many assaults upon them. What connects those countries where the majority of the population speaks English as a first language&#x2014;the United States, Great Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the West Indies and Ireland&#x2014;is far greater than what separates them, and the development of their history since 1900 has been a phenomenal success story. </p><p>Authoritative and engrossing, <em>A History of the English-Speaking Peoples Since 1900</em> is an enthralling account of the century in which the political culture of one linguistic world-grouping comprehensively triumphed over all others. Roberts's <em>History</em> proves especially invaluable as the United States today looks to other parts of the English-speaking world as its best, closest and most dependable allies.</p></p><p><p>Andrew Roberts is the author of <em>Masters and Commanders</em> and <em>A History of the English-Speaking Peoples Since 1900.</em> His other books include <em>Napoleon and Wellington, Eminent Churchillians,</em> and <em>Salisbury,</em> which won the Wolfson History Prize. A Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, he holds a PhD in history from Cambridge University and writes regularly for <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> and <em>The Daily Beast.</em> He lives in New York City.</p>The English-speaking nations&#x2014;America, Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the West Indies&#x2014;are a "decent, honest, generous, fair-minded and self-sacrificing <i>imperium</i>" and "the last, best hope for Mankind," argues this jingoistic peroration. Roberts (<i>Napoleon and Wellington</i>) treats them as a political-cultural unity, thriving on respect for law and property, laissez-faire capitalism and the Protestant ethic, and standing together against Nazism, communism and Islamic terrorism. (Ireland is the black sheep&#x2014;backward, unruly, pro-fascist and Catholic.) His rambling, disjointed survey celebrates their achievements in science, technology, sports and Big Macs, but the book is mainly an apologia for an allegedly benign Anglo-American imperialism. The author defends virtually every 20th-century British or American military adventure, from the conquest of the Philippines to the Vietnam War, finishing with a lengthy justification of the invasion of Iraq; his villains are domestic critics and leftist intellectuals whom he calls "appeasers" and who sap the English-speaking peoples' resolve by propagandizing for totalitarianism (also Mel Gibson, whose anti-British movies sabotage English-speaking peoples' solidarity). Roberts writes in a bluff, Tory style, mixing bombast with jocular Briticisms like a running leitmotif of whimsical geopolitical wagers placed at London clubs. Lively but unsystematic, sometimes insightful but always one-sided, this is less a history than a chest-thumping conservative polemic. 16 pages of b&amp;w photos, 2 maps. <i>(Feb. 6)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

(Fantasy).</p><p>As well as being a bestselling author, Jim Butcher is a martial arts enthusiast with fifteen years of experience in various styles. He&#39;s also a skilled rider and enjoys fencing, singing, bad SF movies and live-action gaming. Jim lives in Missouri with his wife, son and a houseful of computers.<b>The Story so Far </b><p></p> <p>So if the title weren't a big enough clue, the fact that the cover of Jim Butcher's Changes depicts Harry somewhere other than his beloved Chicago makes it clear that the latest entry in the Dresden Files series is, yes, a game-changer for Chicago's only professional wizard, Harry Dresden.</p> <p>Over the past eleven books, we've come to know Harry. He lives in a basement apartment, with his dog, Mouse, and his cat, Mister. He's got good friends: Karrin Murphy of the Chicago PD, Waldo Butters, the polka-loving medical examiner, Michael Carpenter, retired Knight of the Cross. He's got frenemies, like mobster "Gentleman" Johnny Marcone, and his faerie godmother, the Leanansidhe. And full-on enemies, like Nicodemus, the leader of the Order of the Blackened Denarius, and the vampire duchess Arianna Ortega.</p> <p>But <i>Changes </i> takes everything you thought you knew about Harry and his world and turns it upside down. Truths will be revealed. Life changing decisions will be made. And a lot of stuff gets blown up. Take it from us, you will not want to miss this one.</p> <p><b>Excerpt</b></p> <p>I answered the phone, and Susan Rodriguez said, "They've taken our daughter."</p> <p>I sat there for a long five count, swallowed, and said, "Um. What?"</p> <p>"You heard me, Harry," Susan said gently.</p> <p>"Oh," I said. "Um."</p> <p>"The line isn't secure," she said. "I'll be in town tonight. We can talk then."</p> <p>"Yeah," I said. "Okay."</p> <p>"Harry..." she said. "I'm not...I never wanted to..." She cut the words off with an impatient sigh. I heard a voice over the loudspeaker in the background, saying something in Spanish. "We'll have time for that later. The plane is boarding. I've got to go. About twelve hours."</p> <p>"Okay," I said. "I'll...I'll be here."</p> <p>She hesitated, as if about to say something else, but then she hung up.</p> <p>I sat there with the phone against my ear. After a while, it started making that double-speed busy-signal noise.</p> <p>Our daughter.</p> <p>She said <i>our daughter</i>.</p> <p>I hung the phone up. Or tried. I missed the base. The receiver clattered to the floor.</p> <p>Mouse, my big, shaggy grey dog, rose up from his usual napping spot in the tiny kitchenette my basement apartment boasted, and came trotting over to sit down at my feet, staring up at me with dark, worried doggy eyes. After a moment, he made a little huffing sound, then carefully picked the receiver up in his jaws and settled it onto the base. Then he went back to staring worriedly at me.</p> <p>"I..." I paused, trying to get my head around the concept. "I...I might have a child."</p> <p>Mouse made an uncertain, high-pitched noise.</p> <p>"Yeah. How do you think I feel?" I stared at the far wall. Then I stood up and reached for my coat. "I...think I need a drink," I said. I nodded, focusing on nothing. "Yeah. Something like this...yeah."</p> <p>Mouse made a distressed noise and rose.</p> <p>"Sure," I told him. "You can come. Hell, maybe you can drive me home or something."</p> <p></p> <p>I got honked at a lot on the way to McAnally's. I didn't care. I made it without crashing into anyone. That's the important thing, right? I pulled my battered, trusty old Volkswagen Bug over into the little parking lot next to Mac's place. I started inside.</p> <p>Mouse made a whuffing sound.</p> <p>I looked over my shoulder. I'd left the car door open. The big dog nosed it closed.</p> <p>"Thanks," I said.</p> <p>We went into the pub.</p> <p>Mac's place looks like Cheers after a mild apocalypse. There are thirteen wooden pillars irregularly spaced around the room, holding up the roof. They're all carved with scenes of Old World fairy tales, some of them amusing, more of them sinister. There are thirteen ceiling fans spinning lazily throughout the place, and the irregularly shaped, polished wooden bar has thirteen stools. There are thirteen tables in the room, placed in no specific pattern.</p> <p>"There're a lot of thirteens in here," I said to myself.</p> <p>It was about two thirty in the afternoon. No one was in the pub except for me and the dog&#x2014;oh, and Mac. Mac is a man of medium height and medium build, with thick, bony wrists and a shining smooth pate that never showed signs of growing in. He could be anywhere between thirty and fifty and, as always, he was wearing a spotless white apron.</p> <p>Mouse stared intently at Mac for a moment. Then he abruptly sat down in the entryway at the top of the little stairs, turned around once, and settled down by the door, his chin on his paws.</p> <p>Mac glanced toward us. "Harry."</p> <p>I shambled over to the bar.</p> <p>Mac produced a bottle of one of his microbrews, but I shook my head. "Um. I'd say, 'Whiskey, Mac,' but I don't know if you have any whiskey. I need something strong, I think."</p> <p>Mac raised his eyebrows and blinked at me.</p> <p>You've got to know the guy. He was practically screaming.</p> <p>But he poured me a drink of something light gold in a little glass, and I drank it. It burned. I wheezed a little, and then tapped a finger next to the glass.</p> <p>Mac refilled it, frowning at me.</p> <p>I drank the second glass more slowly. It still hurt going down. The pain gave me something to focus on. Thoughts started to coagulate around it, and then to crystallize into definite shape.</p> <p>Susan had called me. She was on the way.</p> <p>And we had a child.</p> <p>And she had never told me.</p> <p>Susan had been a reporter for a yellow rag that covered supernatural news. Most of the people who worked there thought they were publishing fiction, but Susan had clued in to the supernatural world on her own, and we'd crossed trails and verbal swords several times before we'd gotten together. We hadn't been together a terribly long time&#x2014;a little less than two years. We were both young and we made each other happy.</p> <p>Maybe I should have known better. If you don't stand on the sidelines and ignore the world around you, sooner or later you make enemies. One of mine, a vampire named Bianca, had abducted Susan and infected her with the blood thirst of the Red Court. Susan hadn't gone all the way over&#x2014;but if she ever lost control of herself, ever took another's lifeblood, she would.</p> <p>She left me, afraid that if she didn't, I'd be the kill that turned her into a monster, and set out into the world to find some way to cope.</p> <p>I told myself that she had good reason to do so, but reason and heartbreak don't speak the same language. I'd never really forgiven myself for what had happened to her. I guess reason and guilt don't speak the same language, either.</p> <p>It was probably a damned good thing I had gone into shock, because I could feel emotions that were stirring somewhere deep inside me, gathering power like a storm far out to sea. I couldn't see them. I could only feel their effects, but it was enough to know that whatever was rising inside me was potent. Violent. Dangerous. Mindless rage got people killed every day. But for me, it might be worse.</p> <p>I'm a professional wizard.</p> <p>I can make a lot more things happen than most people.</p> <p>Magic and emotions are tied up inextricably. I've been in battle before, and felt the terror and rage of that kind of place, where it's a fight just to think clearly through the simplest problems. I'd used my magic in those kinds of volatile circumstances&#x2014;and a few times, I'd seen it run wild as a result. When most people lose control of their anger, someone gets hurt. Maybe someone even gets killed. When it happens to a wizard, insurance companies go broke and there's reconstruction afterward.</p> <p>What was stirring in me now made those previous feelings of battle rage seem like anemic kittens.</p> <p>"I've got to talk to someone," I heard myself say quietly. "Someone with some objectivity, perspective. I've got to get my head straight before things go to hell."</p> <p>Mac leaned on the bar and looked at me.</p> <p>I cradled the glass in my hand and said quietly, "You remember Susan Rodriguez?"</p> <p>He nodded.</p> <p>"She says that someone took our daughter. She says she'll be here late tonight."</p> <p>Mac inhaled and exhaled slowly. Then he picked up the bottle and poured himself a shot. He sipped at it.</p> <p>"I loved her," I said. "Maybe love her still. And she didn't tell me."</p> <p>He nodded.</p> <p>"She could be lying."</p> <p>He grunted.</p> <p>"I've been used before. And I'm a sucker for a girl."</p> <p>"Yes," he said.</p> <p>I gave him an even look. He smiled slightly.</p> <p>"She'd be...six? Seven?" I shook my head. "I can't even do the math right now."</p> <p>Mac pursed his lips. "Hard thing."</p> <p>I finished the second glass. Some of the sharper edges had gotten softer. Mac touched a finger to the bottle, watching me. I shook my head.</p> <p>"She could be lying to me," I said quietly. "If she's not...then..."</p> <p>Mac closed his eyes briefly and nodded.</p> <p>"Then there's this little girl in trouble," I said. I felt my jaw clench, and the storm inside me threatened to come boiling up. I pushed it down. "My little girl."</p> <p>He nodded again.</p> <p>"Don't know if I ever told you," I said. "I was an orphan."</p> <p>Mac watched me silently.</p> <p>"There were times when...when it was bad. When I wanted someone to come save me. I wished for it so hard. Dreaming of...of not being alone. And when someone finally did come, he turned out to be the biggest monster of all." I shook my head. "I won't let that happen to my child."</p> <p>Mac folded his arms on the bar and looked at me intently and said, in a resonant baritone. "You've got to be very careful, Harry."</p> <p>I looked at him, shocked. He'd...used grammar.</p> <p>"Something like this will test you like nothing else," Mac said. "You're going to find out who you are, Harry. You're going to find out which principles you'll stand by to your death&#x2014;and which lines you'll cross." He took my empty glass away and said, "You're heading into the badlands. It'll be easy to get lost."</p> <p>I watched him in stunned silence as he finished his...</p></p><h2>Frontiers and Wars</h2><p>Used. Very Good conditions.

And you can, too. Here in one volume are two classic works by Brother Lawrence. Each book reveals how to practice God's presence and see His glory in every facet of your life. <br><br><i>The Practice of the Presence of God </i>is a collection of documented conversations and letters that reveal the heart of this humble man. He wrote, "The time of business does not with me differ from the time of prayer, and in the noise and clatter of my kitchen . . . I possess God in as great tranquility as if I were upon my knees at the blessed sacrament." <br><br>Brother Lawrence's wisdom and spiritual insights have helped bring people closer to God for more than three centuries. <i>The Spiritual Maxims of Brother Lawrence, </i>a lesser known but equally outstanding work, is a summary of his teachings. Throughout, he develops one great theme, best expressed by the psalmist, "In Thy Presence is fulness of joy."<b>Brother Lawrence (1614 - 1691)</b><br><br> Brother Lawrence of the Resurrection (c. 1614 &#x2013; 12 February 1691) served as a lay brother in a Carmelite monastery in Paris. Christians commonly remember him for the intimacy he expressed concerning his relationship to God as recorded in a book compiled after his death, the classic Christian text, The Practice of the Presence of God.</p><h2>The Forgiveness Garden</h2><p><p>A long time ago and far away--although it could be here, and it could be now--a boy threw a stone and injured a girl. For as long as anyone could remember, their families had been enemies, and their towns as well, so it was no surprise that something bad had happened. </p><p>Hate had happened. Revenge had happened. And that inspired more hate and more calls for revenge. But this time, a young girl decided to try something different...</p><p>Inspired by the original Garden of Forgiveness in Beirut, Lebanon, and the movement that has grown up around it, Lauren Thompson has created a timeless parable for all ages that shows readers a better way to resolve conflicts and emphasizes the importance of moving forward together.</p></p><p><p><b>LAUREN THOMPSON </b>is the bestselling author of numerous picture books, including the Little Quack series. Her previous book for Feiwel and Friends is <i>Ballerina Dreams</i>. She lives in Brooklyn, New York, with her husband and their son.</p><p><b>CHRISTY HALE</b> has illustrated many picture books and is also the author of <i>The East-West House</i>. She lives in Palo Alto, California, with her husband and their daughter.</p>Inspired by the real Garden of Forgiveness that was built in Beirut after the Lebanese Civil War that ended in 1990, this parable tells of two neighboring villages that have long been in conflict with each other. The striking collage artwork in muted tones shows silhouetted figures hurling stones at their neighbors across a river. Then the story&#x2019;s focus narrows to two young people. A boy, Karune, hurls a stone that hits Sama, a girl across the water, hard on the head, and she falls to the ground. The incident sparks both communities to call for revenge, and the hatred grows. But after Sama&#x2019;s people capture Karune and tell her to throw a stone at him, she refuses. Let us build a garden, she says, and people from both sides agree, even Karune. A final scene shows the young people together in the blossoming garden. The purposeful messages are balanced by the personal story that shows how difficult it can be to create peace, and the afterword will help kids connect news headlines with their own schoolyard standoffs.

In the 100 years since the Wright brothers&#39; first powered flight, aviation has witnessed many memorable events. From record-breaking flights and aerial warfare, to advances in aircraft design and the race for space, Flight covers the most memorable moments in the history of aviation. Describing the feats of the brave men and women who piloted the early flying machines, to the pioneers of long-distance flight and the test pilots who ushered in the jet age, Flight is a gripping narrative of humankind&#39;s quest to conquer the skies and explore space. Loaded with spectacular full-color photographs, dramatic first-hand accounts, and fact-filled profiles on a huge range of aircraft, this is an enthralling account of a century of innovation and adventure.</p><p><b>R.G. Grant</b> is a history writer who has published more than 20 books, many of them dealing with aspects of military conflict. He has written on the American Revolution, World War I, and World War II, and is the author of DK&#x2019;s <i>Battle</i>, <i>Warrior</i>, and <i>Flight: 100 Years of Aviation.</i>This sweeping compendium of milestones in 20th-century aviation history is published in association with the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum, which may account for its rigorous attention to detail. Grant (The Berlin Wall) offers a wealth of supportive information to complement his engagingly written text. Succinct offset biographies sketch the lives and contributions of aviation's pioneers (both men and women), scientists, promoters, businessmen, barnstormers, racers, designers and manufacturers, aces (from World War I to Vietnam), and astronauts and cosmonauts. Fascinating sidebars also treat early flight, assorted inventions, famous air races (1910-39), the gradual transformation of the role of the fighter pilot, the evolution of aerial weaponry, training programs, navigational technology, aerial exploration, landmark altitude and long-distance flights, Zeppelin travel, power plants, Hitler's jet and rocket programs, the breaking of the sound barrier, the Cold War space race, and America's current shuttle program. The impressive illustrations include over 300 gorgeous, full-color profiles of the world's major military and civilian aircraft and space vehicles. The result is a work of greater overall scope and depth than Bill Gunston's Aviation: The First 100 Years.

A very nice car was usually standing in the driveway, a BMW SUV so new the odometer hadn&#x2019;t hit the hundreds yet, and I could smell that canned new-car fragrance through the closed windows. The locks on the house&#x2019;s doors, it seemed to me during my week of taking the occasional careless-looking careful look, would yield to a persuasive argument. No bothersome alarm tip-offs. Inside, I was sure, would be a lot of very nice stuff.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I was right: there was a lot of nice stuff, although most of it was too big to lift. A European sensibility had expressed itself in a lot of stone statuary, some of it very possibly late Roman and some of it, for variety&#x2019;s sake, Khmer, plus a gorgeous polychrome German Madonna in painted linden wood, possibly from the sixteenth century. As tempting as these pieces were, they were all too heavy to hoist, too bulky to carry, and too hard to fence, especially since my premier fence for fine art, Stinky Tetweiler, and I were on the outs.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I was adjusting to the idea that the evening would be a write-off as I went very carefully through the drawers in the bedroom, putting everything back exactly where I&#x2019;d found it and counting down the last ninety seconds. And, as is so often the case, the moment when I gave up was also the moment when fate, with its taste for cheap melodrama, uncoiled itself in the darkness, and my knuckles bounced off one of the things that sends a little sugar bullet straight through a burglar&#x2019;s heart: a jewelry box. It was cardboard, not velvet, but it was a jewelry box, and it rattled when I picked it up.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ever since my mentor, Herbie Mott, taught me the rules of burglary, I&#x2019;ve practically salivated at the sound of something rattling in a small box.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But . . . the lid was stuck. It felt like it hadn&#x2019;t been popped in years, and the accumulation of humidity and air-born schmutz had created a kind of impromptu mucilage. The word schmutz, I reflected as I ran a little pen-knife in between the box and the lid, had entered Middle English via Yiddish and German, where it meant, as it means now, dirt, specifically, a kind of sticky, yankyour- fingers-back-fast dirt.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The top pulled free from the box with a little sucking noise, like an air-kiss. I shook out one&#x2014;no, two&#x2014;objects and aimed my little penlight at them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And heard the hum of an engine: a car, coming up the driveway.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hurrying will kill you more often than taking your time will. I looked at the two objects closely, listening for the motor to cut out, listening for the slam of a car door.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the pieces I recognized immediately, a glittering little slice of history and bravery&#x2014;valor, even&#x2014;in platinum, rubies, sapphires, and diamonds. It looked real, it looked fine, it looked like about $12,000 from a good fence.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The brakes let out an obliging soprano note as the car stopped, and the engine cut out.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other piece, well . . .<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other piece looked like something that had been made in the dark by someone who was following directions over the radio or some other medium with no replay button. Slap it together from whatever was at hand, don&#x2019;t make a second pass, don&#x2019;t look at it too closely. It bore a sort of ur-resemblance to the $12,000 one, in the same way that a supposedly crude revenge play that scholars call the ur-Hamlet is thought to be the direct ancestor and inspiration of Shakespeare&#x2019;s greatest hit, but this piece wouldn&#x2019;t have fooled an inanimate object at forty paces.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A car door closed. Then I heard another.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two pieces were in the same box for a reason. I replaced the lid, slipped the box into my pocket, put the drawer back in its original order, and let myself out the back just as the front door opened.<br><br><b>Chapter Two</b><br><b>The Only Piece of Paper That Could Kill Him</b><br><br>Wattles once told me he was always happy in the morning because he hadn&#x2019;t hurt anybody yet.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it&#x2019;s easy to imagine him singing something late-sixties/early-seventies&#x2014;&#x201c;Take It Easy,&#x201d; maybe, or &#x201c;Born Free&#x201d;&#x2014;as he clumped out of the elevator in the black-glass, medium-rise office building where he did all the bad things that comprised the business of Wattles, Inc. Easy to imagine him, sport-jacketed and red-faced, following his beach-ball gut down the hall, dragging his left leg behind him like a rejected idea and looking, as he had for twenty years, like he&#x2019;d be dead in fifteen minutes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His hair would still be damp. His shave would be aggressively successful. He&#x2019;d reek of Royall Lyme aftershave, forty bucks a bottle, with the little lead crown on the cap. As he would say, class stuff. Taken together, then: all these characteristics identified Wattles as he undid the cheap locks on the outer door to his office.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Identified him externally, that is. Wattles&#x2019;s interior landscape, a column of dark, buzzing flies looking impatiently for the day&#x2019;s first kill, was tucked safely out of sight.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tiffany, the new receptionist, was, as always, at her desk, wearing her permanent expression: pretty in kind of a plastic way, happy, perpetually surprised enough at something to be saying, Oh! A brunette this week, she was wearing her LaLa the French Maid costume, although Wattles actually preferred Nurse Perky. Still, change was good. He&#x2019;d had to replace his first receptionist, Dora, when a truly lethal crook named Rabbits Stennet had nearly discovered her secret, which was that she had been modeled on his wife, Bunny, about whom Rabbits went all Othello whenever anyone even looked at her. Rabbits had once backed his car over a parking attendant at Trader Vic&#x2019;s because the man had taken the liberty of turning on Bunny&#x2019;s seat-warmer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So Dora had been hastily shredded in bulk, all two hundred of her, and replaced by Tiffany: same latex blow-up doll, different nose, different eye color, different wigs.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wattles had probably squinted at Tiffany as he went to the office&#x2019;s inner door and its array of very good locks, because she was sagging a little. He might have heard the soft hiss of a leak, which meant that he would have to find the little battery-powered<br>pump and top her off.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or maybe just pop the valves and let her deflate, replace her with another one. After all, there were more than three hundred and fifty of her boxed up in the closet, waiting for the mail-order lovers who were the clientele of Wattles&#x2019;s one legitimate business. $89.95 a pop, although Wattles wasn&#x2019;t sure that was the best way to put it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the blow-ups leaked sooner or later, thanks to the low manufacturing standards of the Chinese factory where they were produced, which Wattles hadn&#x2019;t complained about because it ensured re-orders. Maybe he&#x2019;d put a new one at the desk. Nurse Perky again. Or maybe Venice Skater Girl, although that was kind of informal for the office, and the shoes were expensive.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So he was probably singing, full of illegal plans, thinking about blowing up a new Tiffany, and smelling all limey when he tried to stick a key into the first of his very good inner locks and couldn&#x2019;t. It wouldn&#x2019;t go in. He leaned down, grunting a little as the movement squeezed his gut, and saw that the inner tumbler was upside down.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So were the others.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The door had been opened, and whoever had undone those very good locks hadn&#x2019;t even taken the trouble to lock things up again.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He went inside, leaving Tiffany to hiss in desolate solitude, and got the TV remote that opened the panel in the wall opposite his desk, but when he turned to aim it, he put it back down. The panel was open. So was the door of the safe behind it. He didn&#x2019;t even bother to go look.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The one thing that was sure to be missing was absolutely going to be the piece of paper that could kill him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He wheeled his chair over to the window and plopped down, watching the San Fernando Valley work up its daily output of smog. Wattles knew whole battalions of crooks, but he could only think of one person who knew where his office was, could pop<br>those particular locks, and was also enough of a smart-ass to leave them popped.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He could also only think of one person who could help him figure out whether he was right.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Problem was, they were the same person. And this, unfortunately, was where I came into the narrative, because both those people were me.</p><h2>Seed Money in Action: Working the Law of Tenfold Return</h2><p>Seed Money in Action provides a way to increase your income through the Law of Tenfold Return.

She was captive in the darkened wings of a venerable Seattle theater, watching something unde�niably magical unfold in front of her. The handsome prince, ac�companied by a breathtaking set of strings, was vocally waxing rhapsodic about the charms of the appallingly lovely girl across the stage, while that girl was accompanying his waxing with her own musical commentary about his perfections. It wasn&#x2019;t long before the pair fell into each other&#x2019;s arms as if they&#x2019;d been born for just that moment, their voices mingling in perfect har�mony, soaring above the orchestra and leaving very few dry eyes in the audience. </p><p>Pippa was sure of that because she&#x2019;d peeked out into that audience&#x2014;after she&#x2019;d dragged her sleeve across her own eyes, of course. Damned dust allergies kicking up at the most inop�portune moments. </p><p>She got hold of herself, then turned back to her purely aca�demic study of the love story going on in front of her. She had to admit, grudgingly, that it looked as real as anything she&#x2019;d ever </p>seen anywhere&#x2014;or at least it did until the handsome prince stepped on the back of his soon-to-be princess&#x2019;s dress and tore it half off. <p>Pippa came back to earth abruptly at the two glares she found thrown her way as the prince and his lady attempted to dance as if nothing had happened. Fortunately there were no further mishaps before the couple managed to get themselves off stage for the last costume change. </p><p> &#x201c;Lovely designs, Pippa,&#x201d; the princess said shortly as she ran off the stage. &#x201c;Too bad you couldn&#x2019;t have sewn them better. I imagine Frank agrees.&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;Pippa didn&#x2019;t design them,&#x201d; Frank whispered sharply, &#x201c;and given what I&#x2019;ve seen tonight, it was a mistake to let her sew them.&#x201d; </p><p>Pippa didn&#x2019;t bother to respond to that. She had indeed de�signed all the costumes, as well as having sewn most of them, but she was standing on the brink of a truly remarkable piece of good fortune, and she didn&#x2019;t want to jinx it by arguing the point with a successful show&#x2019;s director on closing night. </p><p>Though it was really tempting to take the pair of dressmak�er&#x2019;s shears she had stuck in the back of her belt and cut off Frank&#x2019;s ponytail while he was otherwise engaged in sucking up to his leads and belittling the little people. Fortunately for his dignity, she found herself suddenly too busy repairing tears and replacing sequins to do any trimming. </p><p>By the time she had gotten all the costumes put away for someone lower than she on the food chain to worry about clean�ing in the morning, she had given up the idea of revenge. Petty theater directors and grumpy actors were in her past. Her future was a sparkling green city in the not-so-distant distance and there was nothing standing between them but a no-nonsense flight to England. She got herself home through a damp and rather foggy Seattle night, then settled happily into her favorite pair of flannel pajamas before going in search of a decent post-production snack. </p><p>Half an hour later, she pulled her last cinnamon-sugar Pop-Tart from the toaster, then frowned at the smell. Something was burning, and it wasn&#x2019;t what she was holding in her hand. She leaned forward and sniffed her toaster. No, not there, either. </p><p>She followed her nose to her front door, then opened it and looked out into the hallway. Gaspard, her neighbor, flung open </p>his door, shrieking curses in French as he jerked off his chef&#x2019;s hat, threw it on the floor, and stomped out the flames. He looked at her. <p> &#x201c;Run, <i>ch�rie</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>It took her a moment to reconcile herself to the fact that flames were licking his doorframe, which meant he was obvi�ously not just capable of dispensing advice on how to make a killer Bolognese sauce but could also run a mean escape opera�tion. She watched the smoke begin to billow for a moment or two before she realized that she was about to become as crispy as the pastry she was holding in her hand. </p><p>She dashed back into her apartment, tossed her future into a suitcase, then bolted for the stairs. </p><p><i>Several</i> hours later, she stood on a the edge of tree-root-ravaged bit of sidewalk, pushed back the hair that was curling frantically around her face and dripping down the back of her now-soggy pajamas, and decided that there was only one expla�nation for the swirling events she&#x2019;d been plunked down into. </p><p>Karma was out to get her. </p><p>She was a big believer in Karma. A girl couldn&#x2019;t grow up as the child of flower children and not have a healthy respect for that sort of thing&#x2014;and for tie-dye as well, but those were probably memories better left for another time when she had peace for thinking and some mini chocolate muffins to ease the pain. </p><p>She rubbed the spot between her eyes that had almost ceased to pound, then looked around for somewhere to sit. Her sturdy, vintage suitcase was there next to her, looking imminently capable of standing up under the strain, so she sat and was grateful for the recent departure of fire engines and Dumpster delivery trucks. She rested her elbows on her knees, her chin on her fists, and gave herself over to the pondering of the twists and turns of her life. </p><p>She also kept a weather eye out for that rather large and clunky other shoe she was fairly sure was going to be dropped onto her head at any moment. One couldn&#x2019;t have the sort of spectacular good fortune she was about to wallow in without some sort of equal and opposite cosmic reaction. And to keep herself from breaking into the kind of jubilant rejoicing she was sure Karma took note of, she reviewed the path that had led her to her current enviable spot on a suitcase out in the rain. </p><p>It had begun, she supposed, when Susie Chapman&#x2019;s mother had given her a Barbie and a lunch sack full of fabric scraps for her seventh birthday. A world of possibilities had opened up for her, a realm that included plaids and paisleys, stripes and polka dots, all made from fabrics that weren&#x2019;t made from hemp and were probably anything but organic. Her parents would have rent their tie-dyed caftans if they&#x2019;d seen any of it, but Pippa had avoided detection by keeping her contraband doll and those glorious mass-dyed fabrics hidden cunningly in a couple of Birkenstock boxes. </p><p>She had continued her illicit evening-gown-making activi�ties even after she and her siblings had been dumped by her �berflaky parents on the doorstep of an aunt who had sprung, fully formed, from the pages of a Dickens novel. Pippa had in public sneered at romance, fairy tales, and designing clothes for dolls who savored both, but in the privacy of her little gar�ret room she had sewn magical things from the best her lunch money could buy. She had gone on to major in art and cos�tume design in college, then spent the ensuing four years slav�ing away over seams for others to wear in their own fairy tales acted out on stage. </p><p>And while designing for shows had been good practice, her burning and up-until-now secret desire had been to have her own line of clothing. In spite of her own avoidance of the like in her personal life, she dreamed of creating modern things with a hint of medieval romance and fairy-tale magic for others, things with little touches that only those looking for them would see. She wanted the women who wore her clothes to feel like the heroines of their own fairy tales, beautiful and beloved. </p><p>She paused. It was entirely possible she had some unresolved issues concerning romance, knights in shining armor, and her time at Aunt Edna&#x2019;s. </p><p>She made a mental note to consider therapy later&#x2014;after she&#x2019;d eluded Karma&#x2019;s steely eye and leaped at the chance she&#x2019;d been recently offered to make her dreams come true. </p><p>Her sister Tess, who owned an honest-to-goodness English castle and made her living by hosting parties for all sorts of people with money and imagination, had shown some of Pippa&#x2019;s designs to one of her clients. The man had looked at the kids&#x2019; costumes, then spontaneously uttered the magic words. </p><p><i>I say, your sister Pippa doesn&#x2019;t design for adults, does she? I&#x2019;m looking for a new place to invest a bit of money.</i></p><p>Pippa had immediately begun fiendishly working on things to expand her collection, wondering all the while if there might be something bigger at work in her life than simply her wish�ing for it. She certainly didn&#x2019;t believe in magic, pixie dust, or any of the romantic drivel her older sister Peaches read on what seemed to be an alarmingly regular basis. She most certainly didn&#x2019;t believe in the fairy tales put on by any of the theaters she&#x2019;d sewn for. </p><p>But in this, she couldn&#x2019;t deny that there was something, well, <i>unusual </i> at work. </p><p> &#x201c;Pippa, what in the world happened?&#x201d; </p><p>She looked up at that aforementioned over-romanced sis�ter Peaches, who had suddenly materialized next to her on the sidewalk. </p><p> &#x201c;Gaspard had his flamb� get a little too friendly with his natural fibers, apparently,&#x201d; she said with a sigh. &#x201c;What are you doing here so early?&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not early. It&#x2019;s almost nine. And I&#x2019;m here because I thought that since you were leaving tonight, you might need help packing.&#x201d; </p><p>Pippa supposed Peaches would have thought that. Her sister made a living by acting as a life coach, plucking people one by one out of a sea of bills, undeclared intentions, and old pizza boxes to send them off into a new life of organizational calm. Their parents were almost proud of her, though they would have preferred her credentials in feng shui be a bit more solid. </p><p> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all finished,&#x201d; Pippa said, patting her suitcase and hop�ing Peaches wouldn&#x2019;t want to check her work. &#x201c;Costumes for the kids&#x2019; party, my passport, and some granola. And my backup thumb drive with all the new designs I scanned for ease in dis�play. I was sort of in a rush and left everything else behind.&#x201d; </p><p>Peaches glanced at the smoldering ruins of Pippa&#x2019;s building. &#x201c;I imagine you were. And I suppose you can replace what you lost.&#x201d; </p><p>Pippa nodded, though she couldn&#x2019;t exactly agree. She&#x2019;d spent years collecting one of a kind vintage fabrics and trims. In fact, she could have started her own store with what she had stacked on shelves in her apartment, or hidden cunningly under her bed and skirted end tables. There had been a few times&#x2014;all right, there had been more than a few times&#x2014;when she had simply sat there and stared for a few minutes&#x2014;all right, it might have been for an hour or two at a shot&#x2014;at the stacks and stacks of fabric she possessed, all full of possibilities, all waiting for her to take them and make them into something more than they had been before&#x2014;</p><p> &#x201c;I mean, it&#x2019;s not as if you don&#x2019;t have money in the bank,&#x201d; Peaches continued relentlessly, &#x201c;or renter&#x2019;s insurance, or all your valuables tucked safely away in a safe-deposit box like I&#x2019;ve been advising you to do for the past year.&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have any valuables.&#x201d; </p><p>Peaches studied her in a way that made Pippa feel as if her sister really did know that she hid money in her mattress and family heirlooms in hot chocolate cans. </p><p> &#x201c;But the insurance, Pippa,&#x201d; Peaches prodded. &#x201c;You did take care of that, didn&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;I have an appointment with the insurance guy,&#x201d; Pippa said, trying not to sound defensive. &#x201c;At noon today, so yes, I did take care of that. And I did have savings, but I took it all and bought an embroidery machine last week. And a nicer serger. And a few bolts of velvet and silk.&#x201d; She paused. &#x201c;Maybe a few sequins.&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;How many sequins?&#x201d; </p><p>Pippa waved her hand toward the wreckage she couldn&#x2019;t bring herself to look at any longer. &#x201c;I think they would be the enormous swath of multihued sparkles you see up there where the second floor used to be.&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a lot of sequins.&#x201d; She took a deep, calming breath. &#x201c;At least you have your scooter. It could be worse.&#x201d; </p><p>Pippa pointed over her shoulder to where the Dumpster had been dumped earlier that morning. A wheel and part of a fender stuck out from below the container. </p><p>Peaches looked, paused, then laughed a bit. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve had quite a morning.&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;Tell me about it.&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;At least you have your trip to look forward to.&#x201d; Peaches nudged her over a bit to join her on her suitcase. &#x201c;Tell me more about this guy who wants to look at your designs. He could be the reason for all this cosmic attention you&#x2019;re getting.&#x201d; </p><p>Pippa was happy to talk about something else besides the stench of incinerated fabric she could still smell lingering in the air. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know anything about him except that he&#x2019;s nobility and he has really deep pockets.&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;Nobility?&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s the son of an earl, I think, and runs in Tess&#x2019;s academic circles. And he has deep pockets.&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;You already said that.&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;His deep pockets are very attractive to my ultimate plan of fashion world domination.&#x201d; </p><p>Peaches laughed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad to see you haven&#x2019;t lost your focus.&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;Mr. Nobility might front me some dough for more sequins, and Karma is probably done with me,&#x201d; Pippa said with a shrug. She ignored the little niggling doubt at the back of her mind that said Karma was nowhere close to being finished with her. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re taking me to the airport tonight, and I have enough money in the bank to buy more underwear. What else can go wrong?&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;You can open your big mouth, that&#x2019;s what can go wrong,&#x201d; Peaches said quickly. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tempt Fate.&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;Nah,&#x201d; Pippa said confidently, &#x201c;I think the worst is over. Af�ter all, bad things come in threes and my quota is full.&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;My little disorganized friend, <i>good </i> things come in threes. I don&#x2019;t think bad luck is constrained by the same rules.&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;Ridiculous,&#x201d; Pippa scoffed, finding it in herself to rally a bit. She stood and wrapped an emergency blanket around her�self because she was cold, not because she was unnerved. &#x201c;You can go along with all that woo-woo business we were weaned on, but I&#x2019;m not buying it.&#x201d; </p><p> &#x201c;Liar.&#x201d; </p><p>Pippa shook her head sharply. &#x201c;Look, Peach, Karma&#x2019;s done her bit with me this week. In the past eight hours I have lost, in no particular order, my apartment, my life&#x2019;s savings, my inven�tory of irreplaceable fabric and salvaged trims, my means of making a living, and my purple Vespa.

As they travel through 5th century B.C. Greece, Simonides learns not only how to play the kithara and compose poetry, but also how to navigate the shifting alliances surrounding his rich patrons. He is witness to the Persian invasion of Ionia, to the decadent reign of the Samian pirate king Polykrates, and to the fall of the Pisistratids in the Athenian court. Along the way, he encounters artists, statesmen, athletes, thinkers, and lovers, including the likes of Pythagoras and Aischylos. Using the singer's unique perspective, Renault combines her vibrant imagination and her formidable knowledge of history to establish a sweeping, resilient vision of a golden century."[Renault's] historical novels . . . are among the finest ever written."&#x2013;<i>The Washington Post Book World</i> <br><br>&#x201c;A song of praise, a work of love, a serene, deliberate book, full of wisdom, rich in character, incident and description.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>Wall Street Journal<br></i></p><h2>The Way of the Sufi (Compass)</h2><p>In this wide-ranging anthology of Sufi writings, Idries Shah, who was one of Sufism&#x2019;s leading exponents, offers a broad selection of poetry, contemplations, letters, lectures, and teaching stories that together form an illuminating introduction to this unique body of thought.&nbsp;<br><br>Sufism, the mystical aspect of Islam, has had a dynamic and lasting effect on the literature of that religion.

Originally a reaction against the increasing worldliness of Islam, Sufi wisdom still hits home in a modern world obsessed with pleasure and material wealth.<b>Idries Shah </b>was an author and teacher in the Sufi tradition who wrote dozens of books on topics ranging from psychology to spiritualilty to travelogues to other anthropological studies.&nbsp;In his writings, Shah presented&nbsp;Sufism&nbsp;as a universal form of wisdom that predated&nbsp;Islam.

With the end of the Cold War and the emergence of a new world order, this provocative manifesto is more relevant than ever.</p><p>Since its original publication in 1976, The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism has been hailed as an intellectual tour de force that redefines how we think about the relationship among econmomics, culture, and social change. Daniel Bell, the author of such other modern classics as The End of Ideology and The Coming of Post-Industrial Society, argues that the unbounded drive of modern capitalism undermines the moral foundations of the original Protestant ethic that ushered in capitalism itself. In a major new afterword, Bell offers a bracing perspective on contemporary Western society, from the end of the Cold War to the rise and fall of postmodernism, revealing the crucial cultural fault lines we face as the twenty-first century approaches.<b>Daniel Bell</b> is the Henry Ford II Professor of Social Sciences Emeritus at Harvard University and Scholar-in-Residence at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

We all have a duty to affect others&#x2015;from the classroom to the boardroom to social media. But how skilled are we at this role, and can we become better? It turns out that many of our instincts&#x2015;from relying on facts and figures to shape opinions, to insisting others are wrong or attempting to exert control&#x2015;are ineffective, because they are incompatible with how people&#x2019;s minds operate. Sharot shows us how to avoid these pitfalls, and how an attempt to change beliefs and actions is successful when it is well-matched with the core elements that govern the human brain. </p><p>Sharot reveals the critical role of emotion in influence, the weakness of data and the power of curiosity. Relying on the latest research in neuroscience, behavioral economics and psychology, the book provides fascinating insight into the complex power of influence, good and bad.</p></p><p><b>Tali Sharot</b> is the author of <i>The Optimism Bias</i> and a professor of cognitive neuroscience with degrees in economics and psychology.

His hostess for the evening, Lady Annabelle Greer, floated toward him across the elaborately decorated ballroom in the London mansion she shared with her husband, Travis. "And I see you have brought Lucas with you."<br><br>Her gaze shifted across the room to where his best friend, Lucas Barclay, made conversation with a delectable young widow he had only just recently met. Rule and Luke had attended Oxford together. Beyond that, they were shirtsleeve relatives of a sort. Rule's oldest brother, Royal, the Duke of Bransford, was married to a cousin of Luke's brother's wife.<br><br>Rule returned his attention to his hostess. "It's good to see you, my lady." With her light brown hair and clear blue eyes, Annabelle Townsend Greer was nearing thirty and the mother of three children, yet she was still a beautiful woman.<br><br>"I'm surprised you came. You are usually too busy working." She tapped her painted fan against his shoulder. "Don't you know it is highly improper for a member of the aristocracy to labor for money like a commoner?" She grinned. "But then, none of you Dewars have ever given a fig for propriety."<br><br>Rule grinned back. "I might say the same for you, my lady." He could still recall rumors he had heard of the torrid affair that had resulted in Annabelle's marriage to Travis Greer, a former lieutenant in the British cavalry, confirmed bachelor and his brother Reese's best friend.<br><br>Anna just laughed. "I admit to being a bit outrageous at times. Not recently, though."<br><br>Rule smiled. "No, not since your husband had the courage to take you in hand."<br><br>Anna grinned at the ridiculous remark. If anything, it was the other way round. Travis walked up just then, a well-built man with sandy-brown hair and small, gold-rimmed spectacles who was clearly in love with his wife. A respected journalist with the <em>London Times, </em>he wrote articles about whatever war the country might be fighting at the moment.<br><br>The empty sleeve of his coat bore testimony to the price he had paid when he was in the cavalry with Reese.<br><br>"Good to see you, Rule." Travis glanced around the ballroom, the mirrored walls reflecting images of dozens of elegantly dressed men and women. "So which of these lovely ladies has managed to capture your attention? I heard you ended your...association with the beautiful and intriguing Lady St. Ives."<br><br>Rule took a sip of his champagne. "News travels fast."<br><br>"I assume you're on the prowl again."<br><br>He was indeed on the lookout for a new, more interesting mistress. He had grown tired of Evelyn Dreyer, Viscountess St. Ives, and several weeks back had ended the affair. It wasn't Evie's fault, he knew. For some time now, he had been feeling restless and bored, in search of something but not quite certain what it was.<br><br>Travis's gaze shifted away from him and moved around the ballroom. "Or could it be that you are finally on the hunt for a wife?"<br><br>The sip of champagne Rule had taken nearly spewed from his mouth. He shook his head. "I'm definitely not looking for a wife. At least not at the moment."<br><br>No one in London knew he was married. Not even his family. He would have to tell them, of course, and soon. Should have done it long ago. But telling them would make it real. It would force him to admit it was past time he did his duty, went to Boston and retrieved his wife.<br><br>The thought had him excusing himself and heading for the liquor table for something stronger than champagne.<br><br>Luke caught up with him there. "The crowd is beginning to thin. How about we head over to the club? Or we could go to Crockfords, do a little gambling." Luke was nearly as tall as Rule, with dark brown hair and keen brown eyes. He had a scar through his right eyebrow that gave him a rakish, dangerous appearance women seemed to find attractive.<br><br>"Or if you are <em>up to it, </em>we could stop by Madame Lafon's." Luke grinned lasciviously at the pun, but Rule shook his head.<br><br>There was a time the elegant bordello had been one of his favorite ways to spend an evening. Lately, the notion of bedding one of the house's beautiful harlots held little appeal.<br><br>"How about Crockfords?" he said. "I've been on a bit of a lucky streak lately. Perhaps it will hold."<br><br>Luke smiled. "Crockfords it is."<br><br>The one thing Rule wasn't ready to do was go home. If he did, his conscience would nag him. He would think about the money Griff had left him when he died, the profitable investments from his lavish salary and the promise he had made. Though he had kept track of Violet through her aunt, Harriet Ardmore, he hadn't been back to see the girl since the day they were wed.<br><br>He had planned to be there when her father died, but Griff had passed with very little warning, leaving Rule no time to make the monthlong crossing from London to Boston. He'd sent a letter to Violet, of course, expressing his condolences, then was careful to write her a short note at least every other month.<br><br>But it wasn't the same as assuming his role of husband.<br><br>As he made his way out of the ballroom and stepped into the cool night air, he told himself it was time he kept his word. In the next week or two, he vowed, he would book a trip to Boston.<br><br>It was past time he went to collect his bride.<br><br>Rule ignored the sinking in the pit of his stomach.<br><br>Violet stepped off the clipper ship <em>Courageous, </em>grateful to once again be standing on dry land. At last, she was in London. She tightened her hold on the reticule hanging from her wrist and glanced at her surroundings. The docks buzzed with activity: stevedores unloading cargo, passengers disembarking from an endless line of ships along the quay, merchants hawking their wares to a herd of newly arrived, unsuspecting prey.<br><br>Gulls screeched overhead, their raucous cries mingled with the clatter and clank of ships' rigging, sounds Violet had grown so accustomed to she barely noticed.<br><br>"Isn't this exciting?" Her cousin, Caroline Lockhart, hurried along beside her, next to Mrs. Cummins, a lady of impeccable credentials who had been paid to act as their traveling companion.<br><br>"It is quite a bit different than I imagined," Violet said, peering up at the skyline marked by tall church spires and a haphazard array of roofs dotted with chimney pots. "Everything looks older than I thought but that only seems to make it more charming."<br><br>Though the area around the docks was certainly not the best. The buildings here were dilapidated and in need of repair, and aside from the travelers, most of the people on the streets were dressed in shabby clothes.<br><br>"I'll hire us a carriage," offered Mrs. Cummins, a big-boned, sturdy woman with iron-gray hair. They would be parting company soon, once Violet arrived at the residence belonging to her husband.<br><br><em>Husband. </em>The word left a bad taste in her mouth. She hadn't seen Rule Dewar since their wedding day three years ago.<br><br>Oh, he had sent an occasional note but clearly he had no intention of fulfilling his duties to his wife.<br><br>And Violet was extremely glad.<br><br>She had been so young when she had met him. Young and impressed with his extravagant good looks. And she'd been grieving for the father she would soon have to bury. Griff wanted her to marry and she would have done anything to please him&#x2014;even wed a man she didn't know.<br><br>"All right, girls, here we are." Mrs. Cummins led them toward a ramshackle coach pulled by two tired-looking bay horses. The driver tipped his hat as he jumped down from the box and began hefting their steamer trunks into the boot at the rear of the vehicle.<br><br>Mrs. Cummins, very conscientious in her duties, watched the proceedings with a discerning eye. She had taken the job as companion in Aunt Harriet's place since Aunt Harry turned green at the mere thought of four long weeks at sea.<br><br>The substitution was fine by Violet, who had been living mostly on her own since her father died. Desperate to fill her days with something more than sadness and grief, she had begun taking an interest in her father's Boston munitions factory.<br><br>Growing up, she had spent a great deal of time there, learning about the business of making muskets and pistols, enjoying the hours with her father, playing the role of surrogate son.<br><br>"Come, girls," Mrs. Cummins called out to them. "Let us get ourselves inside. This isn't a good place to dawdle."<br><br>The coachman held open the door and waited for each of them to climb into the worn leather interior. Violet settled herself in the seat, adjusted her conservative navy-blue traveling gown and tightened the strings of the matching bonnet beneath her chin, but her thoughts remained on her father.<br><br>In the beginning, he had been concerned that an interest in business might not be wise for a young lady, but soon it became apparent she was far more excited about making money than she was about playing the role of wealthy, pampered young lady.<br><br>Then, six months after Griff had died, Mr. Haskell, head of the Boston branch of the company, had suddenly taken ill and been forced to retire. Aunt Harry had nearly suffered an apoplexy when Violet told her she planned to take over Mr. Haskell's duties, but Violet assured her that she would keep her role completely secret, and eventually her aunt had bent to Violet's very strong will.<br><br>Mrs. Cummins's worried voice drew her attention. "Dear me, what has happened to that address?" Her chubby hands dug frantically through her reticule. "I can't seem to find the paper it was written on."<br><br>"Number six Portman Square," Violet told her, knowing the address by heart. It was printed at the top of Rule's gold-embossed personal stationery, there on each of the very few letters she had received in the past three years.<br><br>Mrs. Cummins rapped on the roof of the carriage. "Driver, did you hear that?"<br><br>"Aye, madam. Number six Portman. 'Tis a bit o' a ride, but I'll get ye there safe and sound."<br><br>"I hope it doesn't take too long," Caroline said with a weary sigh. "I am beyond ready to take off my shoes and put my feet up for a while." Like Violet, Caroline was also nineteen. The two were alike in other ways, as well. Each was a bit too outspoken and unfashionably wont to do as she pleased, but Violet was better at disguising her nature than Caroline, who didn't much care what other people thought of her.<br><br>She glanced outside the window, checking the angle of the sun. The afternoon was waning and all of them were tired. Echoing Caroline's sentiments, Violet could hardly wait to reach their destination.<br><br>Her thoughts returned to the man she had wed and a tendril of anger slipped through her. Rule Dewar had the gall to marry her, then completely abandon her. He had given her father his word, had promised that he would provide for her, and though she had plenty of money and servants enough to staff a large part of Boston, it was hardly what her father had intended.<br><br>And it certainly wasn't what Violet wanted. She wanted a husband who loved her, a man she could count on. She wanted a family and children. She had played the fool once for Rule Dewar. Not again.<br><br>A faint, bitter smile lifted her lips. Rule was about to get his comeuppance. He would retain whatever sum her father had left him, but he was about to lose his half interest in Griffin Manufacturing.<br><br>Violet couldn't wait to see the look on his handsome face when she told him she was there to obtain an annulment.<br><br>It seemed to take forever, but eventually Violet and her party arrived at Rule's London residence, a narrow, four-story brick structure with a gabled slate roof. It sat among a row of similar residences, all of them situated around a small park planted with bright spring flowers enclosed by an ornate wrought-iron fence. Clearly, it was a very exclusive neighborhood, befitting Rule's station as the brother of a duke.<br><br>The thought stirred a trickle of irritation. How ridiculous it was to marry a man for his noble bloodlines. Why, Rule Dewar hadn't even had the integrity to keep his word!<br><br>Not like Jeffrey, she thought, his handsome image popping into her head. Blond hair and warm brown eyes, a nice, sincere smile. Jeffrey Burnett was twenty-eight, nine years Violet's senior, a man of some means she had met six months ago at a party given by a friend of Aunt Harriet's. Jeffrey was an attorney who worked a great deal in the shipping business. Since Griffin shipped armaments around the world, they had something in common.<br><br>They had become friends of a sort, and eventually Violet had confided the truth of her hasty, ill-considered marriage. A few weeks later, Jeffrey had revealed his very strong attraction to her and his interest in making her his wife.<br><br>Of course all of that was moot at the moment.<br><br>First she had to obtain an annulment, which would make possible her second reason for coming on such a long journey.<br><br>She wanted to sell Griffin Manufacturing.<br><br>The driver jumped down and pulled open the carriage door, jarring her back to the present.<br><br>"We're 'ere, ladies."<br><br>Mrs. Cummins gave the man one of her imperious looks. "You'll need to wait, sir, while I make certain this is the correct address. If so, I shall be needing your services again."<br><br>"Aye, madam."<br><br>Mrs. Cummins would be leaving Violet and Caroline there, though there was a chance they would be turned away. She had no idea what Rule Dewar would do when she appeared uninvited on his doorstep.<br><br>As they reached the top of the brick stairs, Violet stood anxiously next to Caroline while Mrs. Cummins knocked on the ornate front door. A wispy, gray-haired man, apparently the butler, pulled it open. He looked down his long beak of a nose as if he couldn' t imagine what three women would be doing on his employer's front porch.<br><br>"May I help you?"<br><br>Violet spoke up&#x2014;she was, after all, Rule's wife. "I am Mrs. Rule Dewar. I am here to see my husband."<br><br>The butler was frowning, his bushy white eyebrows drawn nearly together. "I'm sorry, I'm afraid I don't understand."<br><br>"Then allow me to explain," Mrs. Cummins said, thrusting her big bosom forward as she made her way closer to the door.<br><br>"This is Mrs. Dewar. She has crossed the ocean to see her husband. Now please go and find him and tell him that we are here."<br><br>The man was shaking his head, opening and closing his mouth like a fish on dry land, when Violet stepped past him into the foyer.<br><br>"Where is he?" she asked firmly.<br><br>The butler looked helplessly around for assistance as the other two women followed her inside.<br><br></p><h2>Sex in Human Loving</h2><p>Psychology, Relationships, Sexual Studies</p><p></p><h2>Black Thunder: An Anthology of African-American Drama</h2><p>An anthology of African American plays features Ed Bullins&#39;s The Taking of Miss Jane, George C. Wolfe&#39;s The Colored Museum, and August Wilson&#39;s Pulitzer Prize-winning work, Ma Rainey&#39;s Black Bottom. Original.</p><p><b>August Wilson</b> is a major American playwright whose work has been consistently acclaimed as among the finest of the American theater. His first play, <b>Ma Rainey's Black Bottom</b>, won the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award for best new play of 1984-85. His second play, <b>Fences</b>, won numerous awards for best play of the year, 1987, including the Tony Award, the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award, the Drama Desk Award, and the Pulitzer Prize. <b>Joe Turner's Come and Gone</b>, his third play, was also voted best play of 1987-88 by the New York Drama Critics' Circle. In 1990, Wilson was awarded his second Pulitzer Prize for <b>The Piano Lesson</b>.Given the ferment in black theater since 1975, the period covered by this nine-play anthology, the offerings here are disappointing. The opening and closing plays, George C. Wolfe's The Colored Museum and August Wilson's Ma Rainey's Black Bottom , are by far the best works included, the former a coruscating attack on the cliches of black popular culture, the latter a taut examination of the dynamics of a group of black musicians in the late 1920s. What comes in between alternates between family melodramas derivative of O'Neill and Lorraine Hansberry (Steve Carter's Eden ; Leslie Lee's The First Breeze of Summer ) and failed avant-gardism redolent of the Off-Broadway of the early 1960s ( General Hag's Skeezag by Amiri Baraka and The Taking of Miss Janie by Ed Bullins). At their worst, several of the plays here offer casual anti-Semitism (the Baraka and, in a more guarded context, the Bullins) or vicious homophobia (P. J. Gibson's messy Long Time Since Yesterday ) . Playwright Branch's introduction begins promisingly, with an account of the first African American theater ventures, but quickly degenerates into a catalogue of titles and dates. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Frappe with Philippians (Coffee Cup Bible Studies)</h2><p><p><b><i>Frappe with Philippians </i></b>is part of the <b><i>Coffee Cup Bible </i></b><b><i> Studies</i></b>, a series of Bible studies for women in compact, workbook format that examine the "life and times" of certain Bible characters and the books of the Bible that pertain to them.

What St. Paul is saying is that, since our one Lord (Jesus Christ) instituted only one Church (cf. Matt 16:18-19), that one Church holds only one faith (i.e., has distinct set of beliefs.) If one browses through his hometown phone book, one will likely discover scores ofdifferent Christian denominations, most with their pastors holding doctoral degrees in Scripture claiming to be &#34;led by the Holy Spirit&#34; in their &#34;plain, straightforward interpretation the bible..&#34; The teachings of these various Christian denominations vary widely on many crucial issues of doctrine (cf. the Introduction section of this book.) Since every Christian should desire to follow Jesus Christ as intimately as possible, he should long to hold fast to the one faith that was taught by Jesus and the Apostles and to belong to the one Church that was historically instituted by our Lord Himself. The question t every thinking Christian must eventually ask is: &#34;Which one of the thousands of differently-Spirit-guided,&#39; &#39;Bible-based&#39; Christian Churches in existence today (which run the theological and doctrinal gamut) is the one historically established by Jesus Christ Himself?&#34; Since contradictory teachings cannot simultaneously be true, which Christian Church has the of the Truth proclaimed by Jesus and the Apostles?

Discovering my sister Jennifer, though&#x2014;that was a surprise.<br> <br>On December 10, 2007, I found out that I had a second sister. I was nine months pregnant and about to take my college semester finals. With swollen feet and body parts bigger than I had ever imagined possible, I couldn&#x2019;t even squeeze into a school desk anymore. But earning a college degree was a promise I had made to myself&#x2014;and third trimester or not, I was going to get those finals done.<br> <br>Cleveland was cold, rainy, and gray in a bona fide Ohio winter way. All I wanted to do was finish my exams, cuddle up under a blanket with some hot chocolate, and wait for the imminent arrival of my firstborn. But alas, that was not yet in the cards. I was headed for a study session right after a quick stop at the post office.<br> <br>Earlier in the week, I&#x2019;d missed the delivery of a piece of certified mail, and the notice had been sitting on my desk for several days. Lugging my backpack full of business textbooks to my car, I felt baby give me a stern kick. I almost lost the certified letter notice in a cold gust of wind and rain. Little did I know, this tiny three-by-five-inch piece of paper would turn my life&#x2014;past, present, and future&#x2014;upside down.<br> <br>As a competitive gymnast, my life has always been filled with challenges that would ultimately define my future. From day one, I was taught to be prepared at all costs. And yet, pulling into the post office parking lot that day, I couldn&#x2019;t have been more unarmed, unguarded.<br> <br>After finding my place in line, I did finally wonder who might have sent me a registered letter. Only my family and personal friends used my home address. Looking out a nearby window, I saw that the rain was getting heavier. I needed to get home. I couldn&#x2019;t afford to dawdle at the post office. The holiday season lines were longer and slower than usual, and I was getting antsy just standing there when I had so much to do. It seemed that everyone but me was sending packages or cards to relatives across the globe.<br> <br>I finally got to the front of the line, received my package, and walked out into the rain.<br> <br>As I awkwardly tried to dodge puddles, I stole a peek at the label on the envelope. The bubbly cursive letters seemed so personal, but the name on the return address was completely unfamiliar to me. Back in my car I tore open the package and pulled out a cluster of items: a typed letter, a bundle of photos, and some court documents. Please tell me I am not being sued! Then I caught a glimpse of something familiar on one of the documents&#x2014;my mother&#x2019;s and father&#x2019;s handwriting.<br> <br>The cover letter was a page and a half of cleanly typed words, unequivocal in meaning, straightforward in sentiment. But my head began to spin as I struggled to make sense of even the simplest words.<br> <br>&nbsp;<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve known my whole life that I was adopted ... and that my biological last name was Moceanu.<br> <br>&nbsp;<br> <br>I read the letter slowly&#x2014;again and again. Breathless and stunned, I sat behind the wheel, staring out the window at the cars driving in and out of the parking lot&#x2014;a stream of mothers, grandmothers, uncles hurrying in the rain with their holiday packages.<br> <br>Her name was Jennifer and apparently she was my long-lost sister given up for adoption by my parents in 1987. The letter explained that Jennifer had always known that she was of Romanian heritage, but that it wasn&#x2019;t until she was turning sixteen that her adoptive parents decided to share the details of her birth. They revealed to her the names of her biological parents, and me, her biological sister. She wrote that she had been waiting four years to contact me directly.<br> <br>&nbsp;<br> <br>I feel that I have one chance to show you and prove to you that I&#x2019;m not some crazy person ... I&#x2019;m sure after seeing all of the papers, you&#x2019;ll see that I&#x2019;m serious.<br> <br>&nbsp;<br> <br>Is this possible? I thought. I tried to think back to 1987. I would&#x2019;ve been six years old when Jennifer was born. Was my mother even pregnant? Why couldn&#x2019;t I remember? My life has been one bizarre adventure, filled with highs and lows, one headline after another ... but a secret sibling? I sat in my car for what seemed like hours, repeatedly examining the contents of the package. The information was presented meticulously, like a jigsaw puzzle, each piece carefully and intentionally placed next to the other. The evidence was overwhelming.<br> <br>The photographs hit me the hardest. The girl in the images looked exactly like my younger sister, Christina, born in 1989 when I was almost eight years old. Eventually I could see that while it was definitely not Christina, there was no doubt that she was a sister nonetheless&#x2014;my sister. The resemblance was uncanny.<br> <br>I have another sister!<br> <br>How could something like this be kept a secret?<br> <br>I was an only child for the first eight years of my life. My parents, Romanian immigrants, struggled to provide me a better life than the ones they had left in their homeland. They worked hard to give me every opportunity in life, and once I showed natural talent as a young gymnast, they spent every last penny on my training. My father (&#x201c;Tata&#x201d;) often worked several jobs just to meet the financial burden of my escalating coaching and gym costs. My parents even relocated our family from city to city and state to state whenever necessary to meet my evolving gymnastic needs. According to Tata, I was destined for greatness, so I did my best not to disappoint my parents. By the age of seven I was a serious, committed gymnast, and by the age of nine I was receiving national attention and regarded as one of America&#x2019;s hopefuls. Standing on the podium at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta and receiving a gold medal was the crowning jewel in a successful gymnastics career and, most certainly, the confirmation that my parents&#x2019; sacrifices were not in vain.<br> <br>I took another look at the photos, took a deep breath, and called my parents in Houston.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hello?&#x201d; Mama answered groggily.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you give up a baby for adoption in 1987?&#x201d; I blurted out. I knew I caught her by complete surprise and gave her a morning wake-up call she&#x2019;d never forget, but sitting in my car, in the rain outside the post office, I needed answers.<br> <br>Silence.<br> <br>I felt a strange combination of emotions whirling out of control. I looked at my belly, my unborn baby, while images of my own childhood raced through my head. My parents were devoted to me and worked tirelessly to provide me with everything they possibly could. They wanted me to have every opportunity in life. But what I longed for most in my early childhood was a bigger family&#x2014;brothers and sisters. The birth of my sister Christina in 1989 was one of the happiest days of my life. I remember Mama bringing her home from the hospital and how everything instantly seemed sweeter. A baby sister&#x2014;she was everything to me. We did everything together and today remain the closest of friends. How could it be that Mama had another baby before Christina? Another sister? This didn&#x2019;t make any sense.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mama, you have to tell me&#x2014;is it true?&#x201d; I pleaded.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, it&#x2019;s true,&#x201d; she said quietly in a voice I hardly recognized. I had been so close with my mother my entire life and truly thought that I knew everything about her. I suddenly felt a distance from her, and I didn&#x2019;t like it one bit. I couldn&#x2019;t understand how or why she would keep this from me and Christina. I&#x2019;d expect something like this from my father, who is a born salesman and a master at gently twisting the truth when it suits his needs. He never had a real need to lie outright, since he could wrap you up in his stories in a heartbeat. What he omitted was oftentimes more telling and more important than what he actually said. But not my mother. Mama was a straight shooter, honest to the core. Or at least, that&#x2019;s the Mama I knew.<br> <br>&#x201c;How could you have kept this from me?&#x201d; I cried into the phone, both of us knowing there was no possible answer that would satisfy me. Tears flowed down my face; the floodgates had opened and I couldn&#x2019;t stop. I was a complete mess.<br> <br>I heard my mother crying on the other end of the phone, too. Mama has always been my rock and confidante, and her pain has always been my pain. But at that moment, I felt a total disconnect, which made me feel confused, angry, and alone.<br> <br>I had so many questions, so few answers. My emotions were running in every direction, moving so quickly I could barely keep up. The raindrops hit the car roof like little metal hammers.<br> <br>I felt paralyzed, retracing the steps of my life. Every photo ever taken, every holiday spent, all of our childhood memories&#x2014;there should&#x2019;ve been three sisters. My life reshuffled, restructured in a matter of minutes.<br> <br>Just like that, with the rip of an envelope, I had a sister and her name was Jennifer. She was born October 1, 1987, the day after my birthday. We are exactly six years and one day apart.<br> <br>Jennifer would have been the middle sister. Why was she given up for adoption when Christina and I were allowed to stay?<br> <br>Jennifer had provided contact information, and I was tempted to call her right away, but first I had to learn more. Anyway, I was in no mental state to talk at that point.<br> <br>&#x201c;I wanted to tell you, and I almost did many times. I just couldn&#x2019;t find the words,&#x201d; said Mama.<br> <br>I was disappointed for so many reasons, but most of all I felt betrayed that she had kept this from me all these years. She had been the one I could trust and the one I relied on to always tell me the truth. I felt angry, sad, deceived, and vulnerable. I had always been open with Mama and confided in her things I have never shared with anyone else. And prior to receiving Jennifer&#x2019;s letter, I had thought she had done the same with me.<br> <br>Even though my mother had kept this from me, at least I was able to communicate with her. As for my father, I couldn&#x2019;t bring myself to speak to him for several weeks; I knew, deep down, that he was likely responsible for how things were handled, or mishandled. After all, he had played a key role in virtually all the most painful moments in my life up to then.<br> <br>My father was not a man of the modern age, and even though he loved the United States, he was very much an old-school Romanian. As a father and husband, he ruled our house with an iron fist. Decisions were made by him, obeyed by us, and explained by nobody. To question my father&#x2019;s reasoning as a child was invitation for punishment, and as an adult was invitation for outbursts.<br> <br>Starting with my teenage years, I had clashed with my father many times but had never really been angry with my mother, not in this way. I always felt sorry for my mother; she had such a difficult marriage and wasn&#x2019;t treated the way I believed a wife should be treated&#x2014;with love and respect.<br> <br>My home life throughout my childhood was turbulent, at best. Tata&#x2019;s rage and temper tantrums took a toll on my family. We often found ourselves hiding in separate rooms. I can barely recall a single holiday when my father didn&#x2019;t make a scene or create some kind of chaos. We were always walking on eggshells. As a child, I never understood his rage, and I still struggle to understand why he did such horrible things to the family he was supposed to love.<br> <br>But things had started to soften between my father and me at the time I received Jennifer&#x2019;s package. We still clashed on many issues, but his battle with a rare form of eye cancer had significantly shifted the dynamics of our relationship. He took a big leap when he allowed himself to get emotional and melancholy in my presence. However, all the old feelings of frustration and alienation returned when I discovered that he and my mother had kept this huge secret from me for twenty years.<br> <br>Despite being physically weakened by the cancer treatment, my father&#x2019;s retelling of Jennifer&#x2019;s birth was matter-of-fact and decidedly old-school.<br> <br>&#x201c;You must remember, Dominique, we were very poor, struggling to survive and put food on the table. When she was born, the doctors told me that we wouldn&#x2019;t be able to afford her medical bills. I saw her, and she was born with no legs. We had no money and no insurance. We could barely take care of ourselves and you.&#x201d;<br> <br>No legs?! What does that mean, no legs? I thought. My father had a knack for embellishing, so I never quite knew what to believe.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I remember.&#x201d;<br> <br>And that was it. Nothing more. I&#x2019;m sure the finer details after twenty years in the vault were a little fuzzy, but I expected more&#x2014;something, anything. I needed more of the story, more pieces to a puzzle that was becoming more confusing with each new detail, but my father had said his piece and offered no more.<br> <br>Once again, it was my mother who tried to help me understand.<br> <br>&#x201c;I was given an ultrasound,&#x201d; she began. &#x201c;It was the only ultrasound of my entire pregnancy. We had no insurance and I had not even seen a doctor prior to delivery. I saw the way the technicians looked at the ultrasound, and I knew something was wrong, but they would not say a word, and I left the clinic with no one ever explaining what they saw. I remember feeling scared and uneasy, but tried not to worry. Months later, when I went into the hospital to deliver the baby, they took me to the operation room to perform a C-section. I was without your father, and it seemed as though they put me to sleep with anesthesia almost immediately. All I remember was waking up in a fog&#x2014;and with no new baby. Your father said that our little girl was born with no legs. I never saw my baby. I never held her, never touched her, never even smelled her. I desperately wanted to, but your father told me we had to give her up and that was that. We never looked back because it was too painful. You know your father&#x2014;once a decision is made, that&#x2019;s the end of it.<br> <br>&#x201c;He never asked me how I felt after all of that happened. It was such a horrible time in my life. After I came back from the hospital I cried for a very long time in the emptiness of the streets. No one even noticed my sadness.&#x201d;<br> <br>It seems crazy and tragic that this could happen in the United States in the 1980s, but in my family&#x2019;s universe, it made sense. My father controlled my mother; every meaningful decision was made by him alone. She had no friends or family in this country and spoke limited English. My mother depended entirely on him, and that&#x2019;s how he liked it.<br> <br>My mother spent twenty years hiding the pain and agony of this secret, but on December 10, 2007, it finally came out.<br> <br>Tormented, betrayed, and still in shock, I knew I had to contact Jennifer.</p><h2>The Tale of Ginger and Pickles (Peter Rabbit)</h2><p>Ginger, a yellow tom-cat, and Pickles, a terrier, run a very popular general store but soon run into trouble because they give everyone unlimited credit.</p><p>Beatrix Potter is one of the world&#39;s best-loved children&#39;s authors of all time.

The exercises, intended to strengthen the Basic Five muscle groups, include a set for cardio-respiratory conditioning; recommended for adults 18-50, with adjustments made for different fitness levels, they require 15-45 minutes a day. Anderson also suggests appropriate workouts for other age groups--elementary school children, teenagers, and those past 50. The nutrition plan is similar to Weight Watchers&#39; food group listings rather than a strict adherence to calorie counts, and fad diets are summarily dismissed for obvious reasons. A bit too much recordkeeping for some, but otherwise straightforward and sensible.</p><p></p><h2>177 Mental Toughness Secrets of the World Class: The Thought Processes, Habits and Philosophies of the Great Ones</h2><p>NEW EDITION: Is it possible for a person of average intelligence and modest means to ascend to the throne of the world class?

Faced with doubts (what if he&#39;s a creep in real life-or worse?), Bailey doesn&#39;t tell Alex she&#39;s moved to his hometown. Or that she&#39;s landed a job at the local tourist-trap museum. Or that she&#39;s being heckled daily by the irritatingly hot museum security guard, Porter Roth-a.k.a. her new arch-nemesis. But life is whole lot messier than the movies, especially when Bailey discovers that tricky fine line between hate, love, and whatever-it-is she&#39;s starting to feel for Porter . . . And as the summer months go by, Bailey must choose whether to cling to a dreamy online fantasy in Alex or take a risk on an imperfect reality with Porter. The choice is both simpler and more complicated than she realizes, because Porter Roth is hiding a secret of his own: Porter is Alex . . . Approximately.</p><p>Jenn Bennett is the award-winning author of the Arcadia Bell urban fantasy series, the Roaring Twenties romance series, and the young adult contemporary romance The Anatomical Shape of a Heart. She lives near Atlanta with one husband and two pugs.You&#x2019;ve Got Mail gets a teenaged spin in this story of Bailey, classic film buff and product of divorce, who moves across the country to live in a California surfing town with her dad. Bailey&#x2019;s been swapping movie facts with online pal Alex, a boy who happens to live in that same California town. Alex, though, still thinks she lives on the East Coast, and doesn&#x2019;t know her real name&#x2014;Bailey&#x2019;s mom is a high-powered divorce attorney, and Bailey is all too familiar with the value of privacy. A summer job at a local museum has Bailey finding a new best friend in spunky, British Grace, and a new nemesis in Porter, a security guard and member of a legendary&#x2014;and plagued by tragedy&#x2014;surfer family. It&#x2019;s not long before Bailey and Porter&#x2019;s verbal sparring turns into something more, and while it becomes clear to the reader that Porter is Alex, neither he nor Bailey have any idea. Strong character development makes this a must form romancereaders: bottled-up Bailey has plenty of secrets in her past, and Porter&#x2019;s family dynamics, plus his Hawaiian background and disintegrating friendship with a troubled fellow surfer, give him depth. There are a lot of different, sometimes dramatic, threads here, but the plot never feels overcrowded. Movie quotes kick off each chapter, and the California backdrop is an ideal setting for this uncommonly nuanced summer romance. &#x2014; Maggie Reagan (Booklist, Starred Review)<br><br>A movie-obsessed teen moves to her dad's beach town and unexpectedly falls for an edgy surfer rather than the "film-buff soul mate" she was expecting to meet. The summer before senior year, 17-year-old Bailey Rydell moves from D.C. to her father's small beach town on the Central California coast. The one perk of moving is that "Alex," her favorite chat-mate on a classic-film fan forum, lives there too, and she plans to surprise him&#x2014;not that they know one another's real names (she goes by "Mink" online). Her first day working at a mansion-cum-museum, introverted Bailey, a white girl who sports platinum-blonde Lana Turner pin curls, meets Porter Roth, a "ridiculously good-looking" but cocky 18-year-old security guard from a legendary local surfing family. Porter, who's Hapa (half Polynesian/Chinese, half white), has a unique way of exasperating Bailey. As she futilely attempts to find Alex via chat-transcript clues, readers will figure out his identity long before she does. There's definitely a The Shop Around the Corner buildup to the romantic chemistry, but in addition to their charming banter and online-quiz exchanges, Bailey and Porter also tackle substantive issues such as anxiety, PTSD, drug abuse, cheating, and sexual experience. Bennett creates an authentically multicultural ensemble, from Bailey's Nigerian-by-way-of-London new bestie, Grace, to her dad's Mexican-American girlfriend and Porter's references to Hawaiian cultural beliefs. An irresistible tribute to classic screwball-comedy romances that captures the "delicious whirling, twirling, buzzing" of falling in love. (Fiction. 14-18) (Kirkus, Starred Review)<br><br>Mink and Alex share a love of classic movies via an online group for film fanatics. Seventeen-year-old Bailey and eighteen-year-old Porter share a deep animosity for each other as coworkers at the Cove, a kitschy museum in Coronado Cove, California. Unbeknownst to them, Mink is Bailey, Alex is Porter, and the makings of romantic comedy are put into play. Certain revelations move Bailey and Porter&#x2019;s enmity to sardonic banter to flirtatious teasing and eventfully to some hot sex in the back of surfer boy Porter&#x2019;s van; however, they both feel somewhat horrible about &#x201c;cheating&#x201d; on their online maybe-more-than-platonic friends. A sexier, modern version of <i>You&#x2019;ve Got Mail </i>and <i>The Shop Around the Corner, </i>this will hit romcom fans right in the sweet spot, and the chemistry between Porter/Alex and Mink/ Bailey manages both a spirited charm and a lusty spark. Narrator Bailey is bold, witty, and humorously self-deprecating, while Porter is the bro with the heart of gold. Two subplots and a few too many tropes of the romance genre threaten to send the story off the rails, but the focus mostly stays on Bailey and Porter, who carry the day like true stars&#x2014;the heroes and heroines of their beloved movies would be proud.

With William Butler Yeats and Edward Martyn, she co-founded the Irish Literary Theatre and the Abbey Theatre, and wrote numerous short works for both companies. Lady Gregory produced a number of books of retellings of stories taken from Irish mythology. Born into a class that identified closely with British rule, her conversion to cultural nationalism, as evidenced by her writings, was emblematic of many of the political struggles to occur in Ireland during her lifetime. Lady Gregory is mainly remembered for her work behind the Irish Literary Revival. Her home at Coole Park, County Galway, served as an important meeting place for leading Revival figures, and her early work as a member of the board of the Abbey was at least as important for the theatre's development as her creative writings. Lady Gregory's motto was taken from Aristotle: "To think like a wise man, but to express oneself like the common people." A trip to Inisheer in the Aran Islands in 1893 re-awoke an interest in the Irish language and in the folklore of the area in which she lived. She organised Irish lessons at the school at Coole and began collecting tales from the area around her home, especially from the residents of Gort workhouse. One of the tutors she employed, was Norma Borthwick, who would visit Coole numerous times. This activity led to the publication of a number of volumes of folk material, including A Book of Saints and Wonders (1906), The Kiltartan History Book (1909), and The Kiltartan Wonder Book (1910). She also produced a number of collections of "Kiltartanese" versions of Irish myths, including Cuchulain of Muirthemne (1902) and Gods and Fighting Men (1904). ("Kiltartanese" is Lady Gregory's term for English with Gaelic syntax, based on the dialect spoken in Kiltartan.) In his introduction to the former, Yeats wrote "I think this book is the best that has come out of Ireland in my time." James Joyce was to parody this claim in the Scylla and Charybdis chapter of his novel Ulysses. from wikipedia</p><h2>The Usborne Encyclopedia of World History (With Internet Links)</h2><p>Covers world history from the beginning of the universe to 2000, and provides information about major civilizations, rulers and other historical figures, important events, and scientific and technical advances.</p><p></p><h2>Russian Thinkers</h2><p>Cover worn, page edges tanned. Shipped from the U.K. All orders received before 3pm sent that weekday.</p><p>Among the seven essays collected in <i>Russian Thinkers</i> is perhaps Isaiah Berlin's most famous work, "The Hedgehog and the Fox," which begins with an ancient Greek proverb ("The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing") before taking on Leo Tolstoy's philosophy of history, showing how Tolstoy "was by nature a fox, but believed in being a hedgehog." The other half dozen pieces examine other Russian writers and philosophers, including Alexander Herzen, Ivan Turgenev, and Mikhail Bakunin--although the latter, Berlin says, "is not a serious thinker. There are no coherent ideas to be extracted from his writings of any period, only fire and imagination, violence and poetry, and an ungovernable desire for strong sensations." Few, if any, English-language critics have written as perceptibly about Russian thought and culture as the Latvian-born Berlin, and the history covered in <i>Russian Thinkers</i> is a unique elaboration of Berlin's theses concerning the impact of ideas upon culture.The work of Isaiah Berlin (1909-1997) covered a wide variety of subjects, mostly appearing in periodicals and symposia. Apart from Russian Thinkers, Isaiah Berlin&#39;s other contributions to Russian studies include his translation of Ivan Turgenev&#39;s First Love (available from Penguin) and his Introduction to Alexander Herzen&#39;s memoirs, My Past and Thoughts. Sir Isaiah was awarded the Jerusalem Prize in 1979 for the expression in his writings of the idea of the freedom of the individual in society.</p><h2>Boston Tea Party, Rebellion in the Colonies (Adventures in Colonial America)</h2><p>A Boston merchant describes the American colonists&#39; act of protest against British taxation and the tea monopoly of the East India Company.</p><p></p><h2>Dream of Love (American Dreams, Book 3)</h2><p>In this third and final book in the series, the Davidson family continues to help slaves to freedom as conductors on the Underground Railroad.

Long develops a comprehensive theological vision of preaching (i.e., preaching as &#34;bearing witness&#34;). He then develops all the practical material about sermon creation that comes out of this unified understanding. The result of his deft integration of the theory and practice of homiletics is this basic guide to putting together a good sermon. Ministers and preachers come from within the church, not to it from the outside. Basing his book on the promise, Long shows seminary students and pastors how to reach beyond themselves and the congregation to the greater reality of God&#39;s presence and concern for all the world. His clear writing style will appeal to ministers and students from all churches and denominations.</p><p>"Tom Long&#x2019;s wisdom about the practice of preaching is matched only by his care for the person of the preacher. In this new edition of his classic text, he helps those engaged in the ministry of proclamation to think more deeply about what we do and why we are doing it. He also reminds us that we are not as alone as we sometimes feel, which makes this book an essential resource for all who bear public witness to the gospel." --Barbara Brown Taylor, author of <i>Seeds of Heaven</i> <p>"Like the first edition of The Witness of Preaching, this new edition offers excellence in scholarship that never gets lost in theory. Tom Long puts flesh and blood on his wise homiletical guidance so that readers not only come to new understandings of the preaching craft, but can see and hear how to put this guidance into practice. Reading this book feels like a conversation with a wise mentor, a conversation always grounded in the reality of living congregations. Seasoned preachers, as well as students, will be energized by this lively conversation. If you can choose only one book as a partner in your own preaching journey, this is the one." --Barbara K. Lundblad, Joe R. Engle Associate Professor of Preaching, Union Theological Seminary</p><b>Thomas G. Long</b> is the Bandy Professor of Preaching at Candler School of Theology, Emory University, in Atlanta, Georgia. He is one of the most popular preachers in the United States today.

What sorts of fringe groups exist? Who joins up and why? What do they want and what are they willing to do to accomplish their goals? How serious is the danger? In response to these questions, noted experts John George and Laird Wilcox have teamed up to examine the frayed edges of human behavior.Beginning with a summary of pre-1960 movements, they then discuss conspiracy theories and what motivates extremists. Their thoroughly documented and detailed tour of contemporary groups on the &#34;far left&#34; and the &#34;far right&#34; includes recent militia groups making headlines. Included as well is an in-depth appendix on the use of fake quotes and fabricated documentsa staple of many extremist organizations.</p><p>John George (Edmond, OK) is professor of political science and sociology at the University of Central Oklahoma. Laird Wilcox (Olathe, KS) is founder of The Wilcox Collection of Contemporary Political Movements, the largest collection of extremist literature in the United States.This consideration of militias, supremacists, klansmen and others examines the foundations of hate crimes and movements which are on the fringe of social acceptance and American politics. From social and psychological analysis of individuals who join such movements to summaries of the history of various movements since the 1960s, this provides an excellent account. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>Loosen Up Your Watercolours</h2><p>This is the first title in Collins&#39; new Artist&#39;s Studio series for the intermediate painter. In this beautifully illustrated book Judi Whitton shows how to loosen up your painting with practical exercises, projects, step-by-step demonstrations and numerous hints and tips. All watercolourists like to paint more loosely, but although it may look easy it is in fact quite difficult to achieve this attractive style of painting. Judi Whitton has specialized in teaching and painting watercolours in a loose style for many years and here she shares her experience to enable all artists to liberate their creativity and achieve more freedom of expression in their work. The book covers many of the traditional watercolour techniques and procedures, such as &#39;lost and found&#39; edges, wet-into-wet, simplification and decisive brushstrokes, but all with an emphasis on maintaining spontaneity and a lively style. In addition, there are helpful sections on using colour creatively, planning your paintings, painting vignettes - a much overlooked technique - and working outdoors. A number of paintings by other well-known watercolourists, such as John Yardley, Charles Reid and John Palmer, are also included to show different styles of painting in a loose way. Practical projects, step-by-step demonstrations, studio tips and discussions on a variety of issues combine to make this an ideal book for all those artists who are looking to take the next step and develop their painting with confidence.

Information about them began to be declassified only in the 1980s. Known as the Jedburghs, these Special Forces were selected from members of the British, American, and Free French armies to be dropped in teams of three deep behind German lines. There, in preparation for D-Day, they carried out what we now know as unconventional warfare: supporting the French Resistance in guerrilla attacks, supply-route disruption, and the harassment and obstruction of German reinforcements. Always, they operated against extraordinary odds. They had to be prepared to survive pitched battles with German troops and Gestapo manhunts for weeks and months while awaiting the arrival of Allied ground forces. They were, in short, heroes.<p><b>The Jedburghs</b> finally tells their story and offers a new perspective on D-Day itself. Will Irwin has selected seven of the Jedburgh teams and told their stories as gripping personal narratives. He has gathered archival documents, diaries and correspondence, and interviewed Jed veterans and family members in order to present this portrait of their crucial role &#x2014; a role recognized by Churchill and Eisenhower &#x2014; in the struggle to liberate Europe in 1944-45.</p><p> This is narrative history at its most compelling; a vivid drama of the battle for France from deep behind enemy lines.</p></p><p><b>Will Irwin</b> retired from the United States Army in January 2000 after a career of more than twenty-eight years, half of that in Special Forces. He received a B.A. in history from Methodist College and a master of military arts and sciences degree from the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College. He has done graduate work in modern European history at the University of Kansas and has served as a research fellow at the RAND Corporation. He now works as a defense contractor. Born in Iowa, Irwin lives in Valrico, Florida."Irwin's detailed retelling of these early covert operations and his ability to place these relatively small operations in the context of the Allied campaign will please military history readers." - --Publishers Weekly<br><br>I picked up Jedburghs in an airport bookshop recently, figuring it would be yet another book trying to exploit "Band of Brothers" recent popularity. In some ways, I guess that *is* what this book represents to its publisher, but inside is something original and quit interesting. Jedburghs is the story of the operations of special forces during World War II: hard trained small units parachuted in behind enemy lines. In particular, this program consisted of people who spoke French and were parachuted into France to assist the Resistance (the maquis) by organizing air drops of weapons and supplies, training, and so forth. Irwin is not a particularly gifted writer. His prose is direct and workmanlike, but he's done excellent research and knows well enough to stay out of the way of a very good story. In recreating the events and culling interesting stories from the available material, he's assembled a fascinating book, so much so that I was sad to see it end. If you're buff of this kind of military history, you'll like this book a lot. --By Addison Phillips<br><br>All of a sudden we have several books on the Jedburghs, at least two others come to mind. One thing this author doesn't answer for me is 'why' they were named Jedburghs. He gives us enough info to realize that several explanations have been put forth, however, he is not able to settle on just one. These 3-men teams were trained and retrained up to the very date of the D-Day landings, with some of the men taken directly from the training field to behind the lines action. The teams consisted of 3 individuals, generally 2 officers, and 1 radioman. The 3-men teams were supposed to contain two officers, either British, French, or American, and 1 radioman at Sergeant level. All were required to be experienced in the French language, and the radioman was preferred to have at least 2 year's college. The radiomen had a special radio made exclusively for the rough combat conditions expected, with all members of the 3 men team trained all areas of survival. They were expected to stay alive on their own until the D-Day armies reached the behind the line areas into which the Jeds had been dropped. The Jeds were also expected to arm, clothe, and train all French resistance personel in their areas. One of the attributes looked for in these men was that of having an attitude, or men who looked for a scrap. And during their training this was an ongoing psychological requirement. At certain points as many as 40% of applicants were washed out. After reading this book you realize any of these men who made it, were indeed very special men. The author is very knowledgable about these teams and offers a very readable book. Until these recent books and declassified records, not much public awareness existed concerning these 3 men teams. I enjoyed this subject so much I have another book by another author on order concerning this same subject. One serious flaw of this book: no maps. For those of us without great knowledge of France, general maps and some of the specific area dropzones would have been beneficial. If you enjoy out of the mainstream material on WWII subjects, these books on the Jedburghs, a force of no more than 300 men, may be for you. As an ex-military man, these resilient, courageous men have my fullest admiration! --By Kay's Husband -</p><h2>Shurley English, Level 4: Homeschooling Made Easy - Grammar &amp; Composition, Student Workbook</h2><p>Levels 1-6 use workbooks rather than traditional textbooks for students to practice and test their acquired knowledge and skills.

It is a book for every Catholic&#x2019;s library &#x2014; one that many will want to keep next to their Bible for constant insight and inspiration. <br> <br> The Diary is an amazing narrative that chronicles the experiences of a simple, uneducated Polish nun who received a special call shortly before the outbreak of World War II. The message of The Divine Mercy is simple. It is that God loves us &#x2014; all of us. And, He wants us to recognize that His mercy is greater than our sins, so that we will call upon Him with trust, receive His mercy, and let it flow through us to others. The Diary is truly a vehicle of grace for all who read it, for in reading it one can realize the truth that &#x201c;mankind will not have peace until it turns with trust to God&#x2019;s mercy,&#x201d; (Diary, 300).<br></p><p>Sr. Faustina was a young nun living in Cracow, Poland in the 1930&#x2019;s.

It was just a question of when and how it would collapse...." &#x2014;From the Introduction to <i>Collapse of an Empire </i>The Soviet Union was an empire in many senses of the word &#x2014;a vast mix of far-flung regions and accidental citizens by way of conquest or annexation. Typical of such empires, it was built on shaky foundations. That instability made its demise inevitable, asserts Yegor Gaidar, former prime minister of Russia and architect of the "shock therapy" economic reforms of the 1990s. Yet a growing desire to return to the glory days of empire is pushing today's Russia backward into many of the same traps that made the Soviet Union untenable. In this important new book, Gaidar clearly illustrates why Russian nostalgia for empire is dangerous and ill-fated: "Dreams of returning to another era are illusory. Attempts to do so will lead to defeat." Gaidar uses world history, the Soviet experience, and economic analysis to demonstrate why swimming against this tide of history would be a huge mistake. The USSR sowed the seeds of its own economic destruction, and Gaidar worries that Russia is repeating some of those mistakes. Once again, for example, the nation is putting too many eggs into one basket, leaving the nation vulnerable to fluctuations in the energy market. The Soviets had used revenues from energy sales to prop up struggling sectors such as agriculture, which was so thoroughly ravaged by hyperindustrialization that the Soviet Union became a net importer of food. When oil prices dropped in the 1980s, that revenue stream diminished, and dependent sectors suffered heavily. Although strategies requiring austerity or sacrifice can be politically difficult, Russia needs to prepare for such downturns and restrain spending during prosperous times. Collapse of an Empire shows why it is imperative to fix the roof before it starts to rain, and why sometimes the past should be left in the past.</p></p><p><p><b>Yegor Gaidar</b>, Boris Yeltsin's acting prime minister in 1992, was the architect of "shock therapy" reforms designed to hasten Russia's transition to capitalism in the 1990s. He is currently the director of the Institute for the Economy in Transition, a Moscow-based research organization.</p><p>On November 24, 2006,Yegor Gaidar fell seriously ill while presenting the Russian edition of this book in Ireland. Much speculation at the time, including Gaidar's own article in the Financial Times, attributed the illness to poisoning.</p><p>"Yegor Gaidar, a hero of Russian reform, has provided a courageous and clear-headed wakeup call for his own people and the world. He argues persuasively that today's Kremlin leaders are heading down the same economic path that led their Communist predecessors to disaster. Combining personal experience, deep analysis and a rare grasp of facts �including from previously classified documents �Gaidar has produced a book of insight and importance. It is must-reading for anyone trying to comprehend what really happened to the Soviet Union, why its system was inherently instable, and why nostalgia for the 'days of empire' �fashionable at the highest levels in Russia today �is wrongheaded and dangerous." � <em>George Soros</em></p><br><br><p>"Yegor Gaidar has written an outstanding book of great importance. With extraordinary erudition, he warns Russia against following the course of Nazi Germany, focusing on the double trap of post-imperial hangover and the oil curse. Professor Gaidar also shows how profound and manifold the Soviet collapse of 1991 really was." �Anders �slund, <em>Senior Fellow, Peterson Institute for International Economics</em></p></p><h2>Slippage: Previously Poised, Previously Uncollected Stories</h2><p>Mingling ancient history, modern morality, and the surreal, a collection of stories includes an award-winning novella about a black mind reader who pays a terrifying call on a white serial killer on Alabama&#39;s death row.</p><p>Harlan Ellison is undoubtedly one of the most audacious, infuriating, brazen characters on the planet. Which may help explain why he is also one of the most brilliant, innovative, and eloquent writers on earth. <i>Slippage</i> simply presents recent, typical Ellison. In a word, masterful. The 21 stories in this 1997 collection, which is encased in black boxes, show Ellison at the height of his powers, with several of the stories (no surprise here) major award-winners. Highlights include a black mind reader who pays a visit to a white serial killer, a husband who falls prey to a vampiric personal computer, and a love affair between a young man and a woman who may be more undead than alive. Perhaps even more fascinating are the painfully candid snapshots of autobiography running throughout the volume. Even if Ellison's unsettling fictions are not enough to dazzle you, his often bizarre life experiences as an author will still keep you compulsively turning the page like a polite voyeur. <i>--Stanley Wiater</i>Harlan Ellison has won countless awards in his literary career, including the Edgar, the Hugo, and the Nebula.

With the loss of deferments from Vietnam, reluctant law schools began admitting women to avoid plummeting enrollments. As women entered, the law resisted. Judges would not hire women. Law firms asserted a right to discriminate against women. Judges permitted discrimination by employers against pregnant women. Courts viewed sexual harassment as, one judge said, "a game played by the male superiors." Violence against women seemed to exist beyond the law&#x2019;s comprehension.</p><p>In this landmark book, Fred Strebeigh shows how American law advanced, far and fast. He brings together legal evidence and personal histories to portray the work of concerned women and men to advance legal rights in America. <em>Equal</em> combines interviews with litigators, plaintiffs, and judges, including Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Catharine MacKinnon, along with research from private archives of attorneys who took cases to the Supreme Court, to narrate battles waged against high odds and pinnacles of legal power. <em>Equal</em>, in the words of Professor Suzanne A. Kim of Rutgers Law School, is a book for "anyone interested in how each individual can improve our society through compassion, drive, and creativity."</p></p><p>Fred Strebeigh has written for The Atlantic, Smithsonian, and the New York Times Magazine. He teaches nonfiction writing at Yale University and lives in New Haven, Connecticut.&#x201c;Both a compelling read and a meticulously deeply inspiring account of the varied cases through which American women have fought to gain equality under the law. It will fascinate general readers and specialists alike.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Sandra M. Gilbert, Distinguished Professor of English Emerita, University of California, Davis; author of <em>The Madwoman in the Attic</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;We can&#x2019;t really&nbsp;understand where law and society are going unless we understand where they have been. Fred Strebeigh brings us that history, combining crack investigative reporting, gripping&nbsp;narrative, and moving character portraits. In so doing, he shows us how the law has influenced the lives of women, and how women have shaped the law of the land. Strebeigh gives us heroes and villains, and above all he shows us the price&#x2015;and the human stakes&#x2015;of the struggle for equality.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Samantha Power, author of the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning <em>A Problem from Hell</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>Equal</em> offers a compelling account of America&#x2019;s leading women&#x2019;s rights cases. Through painstaking research, Strebeigh gives us the "story behind the story" of the lawyers, litigants, and judges who made history. With its sharp insight, telling details, and humorous commentary, this book belongs both in law school curricula and on bedside tables. It is a great read and a major contribution to our understanding of women&#x2019;s rights and constitutional law.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Deborah L. Rhode, Ernest W. McFarland Professor of Law, Stanford Law School; past president of the Association of American Law Schools</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Beautifully written and assiduously researched, Fred Strebeigh&#x2019;s book puts a human face on the movement toward legal recognition of sex discrimination. <em>Equal</em> gives us an unprecedented view into the minds of the plaintiffs, lawyers, and judges who brought about a seismic shift in the law. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in how each individual can improve our society through compassion, drive, and creativity. This book is both inspired and inspiring.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Suzanne A. Kim, Associate Professor of Law, Rutgers School of Law, Newark</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Could America really have been so sexist only four decades ago? In this groundbreaking book, Fred Strebeigh reminds us that from the office to the bedroom to the Supreme Court, the answer is yes. Case by case, character by character, detail by detail, he traces how far we have come. When I reached the last page, I wanted to stand and cheer both the intrepid lawyers who changed our country and the author who has so richly, clearly, and memorably chronicled their achievements.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Anne Fadiman, author of the National Book Critics Circle Award&#x2013;winning <em>The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Fred Strebeigh&#x2019;s book is wonderful. It reminds us that the advance toward treating women as equal human beings in this country has been astonishing&#x2015;and it didn&#x2019;t just happen. Concerned, creative lawyers made it happen. Strebeigh tells us how by the dramatic story of individuals: women, men, and their cases. I found it thrilling.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Anthony Lewis, author of Gideon&#x2019;s Trumpet and winner of the Pulitzer Prize for reporting on the Supreme Court</strong><br><br>&#x201c;The stories Strebeigh tells in this readable and engaging book are riveting. They are also inspiring. All of us are indebted to the women he profiles for having changed our world for the better&#x2015;and we are indebted to Strebeigh, as well, for being such a lucid guide to how they did it.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Shelley Fisher Fishkin, director of the American Studies Program, Stanford University</strong><br><br>&#x201c;An ambitious and admirable contribution to the annals of American justice. The mixture of Strebeigh&#x2019;s ardent curiosity about his momentous subject and the freshness of the battles that he chronicles make the book a revealing work of living history.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Lincoln Caplan, author of <em>The Tenth Justice: The Solicitor General and the Rule of Law</em></strong></p><h2>Pet Shop of Horrors, Vol. 9</h2><p>Each volume collects four stories of terror and wonder centering around Count D&#39;s Pet Shop, where the mysterious count sells magical creatures who come with a contract whose terms must not be broken.</p><p></p><h2>MegaMan NT Warrior, Vol. 5</h2><p>A new force has been unleashed from the darkest, wildest realms of the Net--a menace more dangerous than anything DenTech City has ever faced.

There is little to laugh at, however, in the performer's tediously detailed autobiography. It starts with reports of growing up in an affluent suburb near New York City and Joan Molinsky's embarrassment at her parents for living beyond their means. Then she complains cuttingly about lack of family encouragement as she pursued an acting career. The men in Rivers's life are described unfavorably, as are the showbiz folk who impeded her progress. These recollections accompany bitter memories of false starts, frustrations and heartaches while the entertainer worked in dives and endured rebuffs until she "arrived" at age 31 in 1965. Rivers's breakthrough was her first appearance on The Tonight Show, with Johnny Carson, whom she duly thanks here for empathizing with her humor. Photos not seen by PW. First serial to Cosmopolitan; Literary Guild featured alternate. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.Who would expect a book by and about Rivers to be thoughtful, sensitive, and introspective? And yet here we have an autobiography of a brash entertainer that is not simply an excuse for one-liners and name dropping. Rivers, with the aid of Meryman, writes mostly about her early heartbreaking years of trying to make it as a comic artist. She also tells of her long love-hate relationship with her parents and their lack of support and faith in her burgeoning career. Rivers's recent rise to her present position as co-host of the Tonight Show gets scant coverage. More important is the author's explanation of how she tailors her comedy to fit the audience and her cogent analysis of what makes people laugh. Recommended for most public libraries.

And it seems as if Shatner is everywhere. Winning an Emmy for his role on <i>Boston Legal</i>. Doing commercials for&nbsp;Priceline.com. In the movie theaters. Singing with Ben Folds. He&#x2019;s sitting next to Jay Leno and Jimmy Kimmel, and he&#x2019;s practically a regular on Howard Stern&#x2019;s show. He was recently honored with election to the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences Hall of Fame.&nbsp;He was a&nbsp;target on a Comedy Central&#x2019;s <i>Celebrity Roast</i> entitled &#x201c;The Shat Hits the Fan.&#x201d; In <i>Up Till Now,</i> Shatner sits down with readers and offers the remarkable, full story of&nbsp;his life and explains how he got to be, well, everywhere. </p><p>It was the original <i>Star Trek </i>series, and later its films, that made Shatner instantly recognizable, called by name---or at least by Captain Kirk&#x2019;s name---across the globe. But Shatner neither began nor has ended his career with that role. From the very start, he took his skills as an actor and put them to use wherever he could. He straddled the classic world of the theater and the new world of television, whether stepping in for Christopher Plummer in Shakespeare&#x2019;s <i>Henry V </i>or staring at &#x201c;something on the wing&#x201d; in a classic episode of <i>The Twilight Zone. </i>And since then, he&#x2019;s gone on to star in numerous successful shows, such as <i>T.J. Hooker,</i> <i>Rescue 911, </i>and most recently <i>Boston</i><i> Legal. </i></p><p>William Shatner has always been willing to take risks for his art. What other actor would star in history&#x2019;s first---and probably only---all-Esperanto-language film? Who else would share the screen with thousands of tarantulas, release an album called <i>Has Been, </i>or film a racially incendiary film in the Deep South during the height of the civil rights era? And who else would willingly paramotor into a field of waiting fans armed with paintball guns, all waiting for a chance to stun Captain...er, Shatner?</p><p>In this touching and very funny autobiography, William Shatner reveals the man behind these unforgettable moments, and how he&#x2019;s become the worldwide star and experienced actor he is today. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>William Shatner played Captain Kirk of the <i>USS Enterprise</i> on <i>Star Trek </i>from 1966 to 1969 and in seven <i>Star Trek </i>movies. He also played Police Sergeant T.J Hooker, from 1982 to 1986, and has worked as a musician, producer, director, and celebrity pitchman, recently for Priceline.com. He&nbsp;has won&nbsp;two Emmys and a Golden Globe for his role as&nbsp;attorney Denny Crane on the TV drama <i>Boston Legal</i>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>David Fisher is the author of more than fifteen <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers. He is the only writer ever to have works of fiction, nonfiction, and reference offered simultaneously by theBook of the Month Club. He lives in New York with his wife, two teenagers, one dog, and one cat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>CHAPTER ONE <p></p>I was going to begin my autobiography this way: <p></p>Call me . . . Captain James T. Kirk or Sergeant <p></p>T.J. Hooker or Denny Crane Denny Crane or Twilight Zone plane passenger Bob Wilson or the Big Giant Head or Henry V or the Priceline Negotiator or . . . <p></p>Well, that's the problem, isn't it? I've been a working actor for more than half a century and I've played so many different roles on the stage, on television, and in the movies that it would be impossible to focus on just one of them. Besides, my career as an actor is only part of my story, so I realized I couldn't begin this book that way. <p></p>Then I decided I was going to start this book by telling the story of my memorable meeting with Koko the gorilla: <p></p>In 1988, to help the Gorilla Foundation encourage Californians to contribute to its Endangered Species Campaign, I was permitted to visit Koko the gorilla in her quarters. Koko was an extraordinary animal who had learned to communicate with human beings. She was able to sign more than six hundred words, but more impressively, as her handlers told me, she understood the meaning of those words. She knew the signs for water and for bird and the first time she saw a duck landing on a lake she signed water bird. That displayed a synthesis of knowledge. So you see, she was obviously very intelligent. I was allowed to go into her compound, to enter a room with her all alone. As I walked into that room I was reminded that she was an imposing, powerful animal; smaller gorillas have been known to tear off men's arms in anger. I am not often afraid, but truthfully I was frightened. <p></p>There is a form of acting that teaches: feel it and say it, and that feeling will be revealed through your words. The English form is quite different: say it and then you feel it. To deal with my fear of this magnificent animal as I got closer and closer to her I found myself saying, "I love you, Koko. I love you." I said it earnestly and honestly and I looked directly in her eyes as I spoke. I crouched over a little to show submission, moving forward rather than backward to show I was not afraid. Over and over I repeated, "I love you, Koko, I love you." And as I said it, I began to feel that love. Finally I stopped directly in front of her and looked into her deep brown eyes and saw her furrowed brow and her enormous hands. I love you, Koko. <p></p>And with that she reached out and grabbed me by my balls. And looked me right in the eyes. After a slight pause-in a substantially higher voice-I tried to repeat, "I love you, Koko." Obviously these words had more significance than a few seconds earlier. <p></p>Her handler, standing just outside the room, said, "Stand very still. She wants you to go to her bedroom." So I stood very still because I did not want to go to her bedroom. I think it is fair to say that few people in history have ever stood as still as I did at that moment. Meanwhile, in the adjoining compound a young gorilla who they hoped would mate with Koko was pounding on the door like a jealous husband. There I was, caught in the eternal triangle, with a gorilla holding on to my rapidly shrinking scrotum. Eventually she got bored... <p></p>Starting this book with that story would enable me to inform the reader that it's not going to be limited to my professional career, that it will also include stories about all the extraordinary opportunities I've been given to explore the world. I'd discuss all the amazing experiences I've had, from that dark night in Africa when I pursued a wild elephant to the afternoon a helicopter left me more alone than I'd ever been in my life on top of a twenty-thousand-foot-high glacier, and even to that memorable moment when I saw aliens in the desert. And it would also demonstrate that there are going to be a lot of laughs in this book, most of them at my expense. But then I realized that people know me primarily from the work I've done as an actor, so that wouldn't be effective as a beginning. So I decided not to begin that way either. <p></p>Then I had a great idea. I was going to start the book by quoting the lyrics to a song I'd written about the truly tragic death by drowning of my beautiful wife, Nerine Shatner: <p></p>My love was supposed to protect her It didn't My love was supposed to heal her It didn't You had said don't leave me And I begged you not to leave me We did <p></p>Opening the book that way would be so meaningful to me, beginning with the great tragedy of my life. And it would immediately let readers know that this is to be a truthful book. But it would also be such a sad beginning, when my life has been filled with so much joy. And of course, I'm not known for my singing; in fact there are those who believe my performance of "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" may be the worst version of a Beatles song ever recorded. Not me- of course. And this is such a personal story that it needs to be told in its entirety, so certainly I couldn't begin my book that way. <p></p>There is one extremely well-known phrase that I definitely decided I would not use to begin this book: <p></p>"Beam me up, Scotty." <p></p>In fact, I am determined that this phrase will not appear anywhere in this book. <p></p>The beginning, I knew, needed to catch the interest of the reader within a few words, to engage their curiosity, to make them wonder, perhaps, what the hell is he talking about? Which led to: <p></p>I arrived in New York City for the first time in my life in an Indian outrigger canoe, having paddled all the way from Montreal... <p></p>I liked that, but it didn't seem to convey the essence of my life. Somehow it seemed too gimmicky, too clever, so I knew I couldn't use that. Maybe later in the first chapter, I decided. <p></p>It occurred to me that perhaps I should open this book with a description of the day I took my beautiful horse, Sultan's Great Day, for his final walk in the pasture. Oh my, you should have seen him in his world-championship days. I'm telling you, this was the most magnificent stallion you've ever seen. I'm not kidding about that. Really, people were in awe of his presence. They would look at him and... <p></p>I would use that beginning to tell you about my passions, the passions that have made all the difference in my life. The passions that I've spent my life pursuing: the love of a beautiful woman, the love for my family, the love for my craft, my art, the need to experience every aspect of life. Sometimes I'm amazed to realize that I live today with the vestiges of my priorities as a young man, the desire to act, the need to be loved, the pleasures of a great meal, a great laugh, and enduring companionship. <p></p>But simply telling you about my passions-even my passion for horses and dogs-seemed far too somber an opening. <p></p>Perhaps, I thought, I should start this book by being glib, by exposing my quirky sense of humor to the readers. Make them laugh at the very beginning by quoting a newspaper story about one of the more unusual things I've ever done: <p></p>(AP) 1/17/2006 Actor William Shatner agreed on Monday to sell his kidney stone for $75,000 to an online casino. The money will go to Habitat for Humanity. "This takes organ donors to a new height, or perhaps a new low," said Shatner. The auction price includes the surgical stent and string used to permit passage of the stone. <p></p>According to Shatner, the kidney stone was so big, "[Y]ou'd want to wear it on your finger. If you subjected it to extreme heat, it might turn out to be a diamond..." <p></p>While that beginning certainly would be humorous, it just seemed too frivolous to start that way. Instead, it occurred to me that the opening of this book should be thoughtful, it should be about my life. How much more sincere could I be about the life I've had than using words written by David E. Kelley for the character I play on Boston Legal, Denny Crane Denny Crane: <p></p>Evening: Crane and Shore on the balcony outside Crane's office <p></p>CRANE <p></p>Alan Shore believes man has a soul. Stop the presses. <p></p>SHORE <p></p>Don't you believe it? Can this be all there is? And if so... <p></p>have we not wasted... <p></p>CRANE <p></p>I haven't wasted a second. I've enjoyed my ride, all of it. <p></p>SHORE <p></p>But will it have truly counted for something? <p></p>CRANE <p></p>You've heard the old joke, Alan. Man shows up at the pearly gates, sees this guy in a pinstripe suit, briefcase, cigar, prancing about, he says to St. Peter, "Who the hell is that?" St. Peter says, "Oh that's just God. Thinks he's Denny Crane." <p></p>SHORE <p></p>What would you do, Denny, if you actually met God one day? <p></p>CRANE <p></p>I dunno. Probably take him fishing. <p></p>For a brief time I had decided this was the perfect way to open this book. Then it occurred to me, let Denny Crane write his own book! Finally, inspiration struck! I had what I believed would be a unique and perfect opening: <p></p>Are you tired of paying full price for this book? Well, you don't have to. You can buy as many copies of it as you like-and you name the price! That's right, you name the price you want to pay. At Priceline.com it's as simple as that. Here's the way... <p></p>Opening this book like that would be funny, yet accurate, as many people know me from my work representing various companies, such as Priceline.com. And if we also could sell a few more copies of this book, well, I didn't think St. Martin's would object. And if Priceline was approached properly by my agent, perhaps they might even be willing to purchase the rights to the opening paragraph. For less than full price, of course. <p></p>But perhaps that was too crass for the opening of my autobiography, I decided. Is that really what I wanted to emphasize about my life and my career? And would Priceline meet my price? So that opening too, was rejected. <p></p>And then it occurred to me: I don't need an opening. By the time you've reached this paragraph my autobiography has already started. Of course that was very similar to my career; I was already in the middle of it before I realized it had begun. <p></p>The first time I stood on a stage I made the audience cry. <p></p>Let me establish the rules for this book. I will tell all the jokes unless I specifically identify a straight line. In which case you will have the opportunity make up the jokes. <p></p>I was six years old, attending Rabin's Camp, a summer camp for Jewish welfare cases run by my aunt in the mountains north of Montreal. I wanted to box at that camp-hitting people seemed like fun-but my aunt instead put me in a play named Winterset. My role was that of a young boy forced to leave his home because the Nazis were coming. In the climactic scene I had to say good-bye to my dog, knowing I probably would never see him again. My dog was played by another camper, costumed in painted newspaper. We performed the play on parents' weekend to an audience consisting primarily of people who had escaped the Nazis, many of whom still had family members trapped in Hitler's Europe. So many of them had left everything they knew or owned behind-and there I was, saying good-bye to my little doggie. <p></p>I cried, the audience cried, everybody cried. I remember taking my bow and seeing people wiping away their tears. I remember the warmth of my father holding me as people told him what a wonderful son he had. Just imagine the impact that had on a six-year-old child. I had the ability to move people to tears. And I could get approval. <p></p>Something in me always wanted to perform, always wanted the attention that came from pleasing an audience. Years before my camp debut my older sister remembers my mother taking the two of us downtown. Apparently I ran away and it took them several hectic minutes to find me-dancing happily in front of an organ-grinder. <p></p>Where did that come from? That need to please people? What part of me was born with the courage to stand in front of strangers and risk rejection? There was nothing at all like that in my family history. The Shatner family was Polish and Austrian and Hungarian, and apparently several of my forebears were rabbis and teachers. <p></p>Like so many Jewish immigrants my father was in the schmatta business-he manufactured inexpensive men's suits for French-Canadian clothing stores. Admiration Clothes. They were basically suits for workingmen who owned only one suit. Joseph Shatner was a stern but loving man, a hard-working man. I can close my eyes and remember the smell of his cutting room. The unforgettable aroma of raw serge and tweed in rolled-up bales, mixed with the smell of my father's cigarettes. Saturday afternoon was the only time he would relax, lying on the couch and listening to New York's Metropolitan Opera on the radio. He came to Montreal from Eastern Europe when he was fourteen, and worked selling newspapers and in other labor-intensive jobs. He started in the clothing business packing boxes and eventually became a salesman and finally started his own small company. He was the first member of his family to come to North America, but eventually he helped all ten of his brothers and sisters leave Europe. My friend Leonard Nimoy likes to joke about the fact that I never stop working; he does an imitation of me in which he says, "It's quarter of four. What's scheduled for four-ten? If I'm done there by four-thirty can we get something for four-fifty?" <p></p>Perhaps there is some truth to that. Every actor has spent days... months staring at the telephone, willing it to ring. And living with the hollow fear that it might never ring again. Painting the walls over again while waiting for the next offer. After beginning my career I went more than twenty years without taking a real vacation, petrified I might miss a phone call. Having had that experience, having lived in the back of pickup trucks in the parking lots of summer theaters, indeed I am open to opportunities. But there is a general belief that I will accept almost anything that I'm offered and that certainly is not true. It was less than two years ago that I turned down an offer. Like any actor, I'm concerned about being overexposed, so I've been very careful to limit myself to acting on the stage and in dramatic television programs, hosting documentary-type programs and game shows, appearing in movies and commercials, endorsing products, doing voice-overs, charity appearances, radio programs, Webcasts, videos, Star Trek conventions, game shows, horse shows and dog shows, writing books and songs, making albums, creating, directing and producing television programs, performing at concerts, and appearing on talk shows, competitive reality-type shows, and award programs. But that's where I draw the line. For example, I rarely do bar mitzvahs and I've never worked in the Catskills. <p></p>My work ethic comes from my father. His dream was that I would eventually take over the business. So, as he had done, I worked in the factory packing suits. One of my skills is good packing. I know how to fold a suit with the shoulders touching inside-out, the sleeves down, folded flat so it stays pressed. I know the correct way to fold pants and put them in a box. Had I not become an actor I could have had a fine career in folding. <p></p>But acting? What did my father know from acting? Acting smacting, that wasn't a thing real people did, it wasn't a job. It wasn't what people did to earn a living. It was playing. <p></p>From my father I learned the value of education, respect for others around me, and to be on time and prepared to work. Eleven-oh-five, he used to tell me, was not eleven o'clock. All my life I have been on time and prepared to work. I'll tell you how deeply that ethic is ingrained in me. In 2007 I was invited by ABC to participate in a show entitled Fast Cars and Superstars, actually a NASCAR celebrity race. This was an opportunity to dri...</p><h2>Perfection Salad: Women and Cooking at the Turn of the Century</h2><p>Perfection Salad presents an entertaining and erudite social history of women and cooking at the turn of the twentieth century. With sly humor and lucid insight, Laura Shapiro uncovers our ancestors&#39; widespread obsession with food, and in doing so, tells us why we think as we do about food today.</p><p>Perfection Salad, a dish that won its creator first prize in a 1905 cooking contest, consisted of pristine molded aspic containing celery, red pepper, and chopped cabbage. Laura Shapiro, author of this eponymous social history, part of the Modern Library Food series, takes the salad as a model for the domestic science movement, an intriguing women's crusade of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Bent on convincing housewives that the way to domestic order lay in cooking "dainty" nutritional meals from sanitary ingredients in "scientific" kitchens, the movement helped give birth to our mass-market food scene, with its reliance on home economics precepts, processed convenience foods, and no-cook cooking--our cuisine of boil-in bags and microwave frozen dinners. Entertaining and informative, but also unexpectedly moving, the book chronicles in numerous intriguing stories the ways in which an impulse to liberate women from the drudgery and imprecision of daily food preparation led to its debasement. It's a fascinating story, of interest to anyone who wonders why and how we cook and eat--and think about food--as we do.<p> Beginning with portraits of early domestic movement reformers such as Catherine Beecher and Mary Lincoln, and investigating institutions like the Boston Cooking School, home of Fannie Farmer, the Mother of Level Measurements, the book then pursues "scientific cookery" into its mid-20th-century manifestation. "With the help of the new industry of advertising," Shapiro writes, "the food business was able to reflect Mrs. Lincoln's values [of food-production uniformity] by keeping its achievements in packing, sanitation, convenience, and novelty at the forefront." But greater ills ensued: the effect of the reformers, Shapiro contends, was to encourage women to become docile consumers tethered to commercial interests--and to rob our vigorous cooking and eating traditions of their rich life. In making that point, <i>Perfection Salad</i> reveals its true subject: the cultural priorities that defined American 20th-century life and, finally, the sorry nature of the order they established. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p>"Shapiro recounts the story of scientific cooking with a deft humor some might find unbecoming to a work of impeccable scholarship. Yet how else are we to think about a movement that upheld mayonnaise, cream sauce, and the extended boiling of vegetables as cures for every social ill, from drunkenness and degeneracy to feminism and labor unrest?.... My only disappointment with <i>Perfection Salad</i> is that it ends too soon." --Barbara Ehrenreich, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br>"A comprehensive, droll social history of a curious women's movement that's responsible for everything from nutritional education programs to TV dinners."--Maureen Corrigan, <i>Village Voice</i></p><h2>The Wet Engine: Exploring Mad Wild Miracle of Heart</h2><p><p>"Every creature on earth has approximately two billion heartbeats to spend in a lifetime. You can spend them slowly, like a tortoise, and live to be two hundred years old, or you can spend them fast, like a hummingbird, and live to be two years old."<br><br> The heart: it is known as the seat of the soul, the power house of the body, the essence of spirituality. No other bodily organ has so captured the imagination of human beings since the beginning of time.</p><br><p>This startling, genuinely unique book moves like a freight train through the scientific, emotional, literary, philosophical, and spiritual understandings of the heart -- from cardiology to courage, from love letters and pop songs to Jesus. The torment of Doyle's own infant son's heart surgery is the thread weaving the strands together, but the wisdom is for every person who seeks a more passionate life, in touch with the heart of God.</p><br><p>"This wonderful book has two heroes: a small boy with a damaged heart, and a surgeon who knows how to repair the damaged hearts of small boys. Such heroes deserve a gifted poet to sing their songs. Brian Doyle is that poet." -Chet Raymo, author of <i>Climbing Brandon: Science and Faith on Ireland's Holy Mountain</i></p></p><p>BRIAN DOYLE is the Editor of Portland Magazine, winner of three consecutive national gold medals as the finest small-circulation university magazine in the United States. An award-winning essayist, he has authored five other books and his writing has appeared in The Best American Essays and The Best Spiritual Essays. He lives with his family in Portland, Oregon.Nine years ago the author's wife gave birth to twin boys. One was entirely normal, but the other was missing a chamber in his heart. At five months and again at 18 months, Liam had open-heart surgery. Someday he will need a heart transplant, but for now he "runs around like an insane dorky gawky goofy heron and rides his bike and shoots hoop, and skateboards and swings and punches out his brother and snarls at his sister and refuses to make his bed...." This book is about Liam, and it is also about his surgeon, his family and dozens of others with heart-related stories. It is about <i>heart</i> as a physical organ&#x2014;how it is supposed to work, how surgeons try to fix it when it doesn't&#x2014;and about <i>heart</i> as a metaphor for "the distilled essence of character and spirit." Most of all, it is about love, which has "many forms and levels and shapes and flavors and speeds and depths and topographies and landscapes and colors and musics." Doyle, the author of four other books of essays, sometimes spins out of control with sprawling stream-of-consciousness sentences, and he says "waaaay" waaaay too often. Still, it is hard to put down this wide-ranging meditation on the fragile mysteries of human life. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Packed in hay in the hold were large chunks of ice cut from a frozen Massachusetts lake. This was the first venture of a young Boston entrepreneur, Frederic Tudor, who believed he could make a fortune selling ice to people in the tropics. </p><p>Ridiculed at the outset, Tudor endured years of hardship before he was to fulfill his dream. Over the years, he and his rivals extended the frozen-water trade to Havana, Charleston, New Orleans, London, and finally to Calcutta, where in 1833 more than one hundred tons of ice survived a four-month journey of 16,000 miles with two crossings of the equator. <em>The Frozen-Water Trade</em> is a fascinating account of the birth of an industry that ultimately revolutionized domestic life for millions of people.</p></p><p><b>Gavin Weightman</b> is a journalist, author, and documentary filmmaker. He lives in London with his wife, the illustrator Clare Beaton, and their son, Tom.Weightman, a London journalist and documentary filmmaker, uncovers a secret history and ends up transforming a dull-sounding topic into a riveting read. He introduces turn-of-the-19th-century Bostonian Frederic Tudor as an indefatigable American dreamer who sought to give people something they didn't know they wanted-and make a killing while he's at it. Tudor hatches scheme after scheme to "farm" ice from New England ponds and deliver chunks of the brand-new commodity to the Caribbean, and ultimately to India and elsewhere, so that items like cold beverages and ice cream become cultural staples. Along the way Tudor encounters disbelievers, creditors, rivals, imprisonment, yellow fever, warm weather, political scuffles-even pirates. Weightman also delves engagingly into the science of freezing and the particulars and economics of ice transport and storage. Through it all, Weightman juggles the players in the burgeoning but finally ephemeral business while he spins a tale of a pre-refrigerated world. Issues of commerce and entrepreneurship in an infant nation are revealed in this page-turner, which gets its title from the name of the industry. When Weightman visits Tudor's original ice source, locals think the author is loony for suggesting that cubes from the pond cooled people in Calcutta two centuries earlier-and made one man (and perhaps many others) rich in the process. Weightman takes a relatively unknown part of history (and the figure at its center), and creates a funny, rollicking human adventure.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Fandex Family Field Guides: Trees</h2><p>Bringing the world of TREES to your fingertips, FANDEX presents a foolproof field guide.

Even people who would never have thought that a religious problem could be a serious matter that concerned them personally are beginning to ask themselves fundamental questions. Under these circumstances it would not be at all surprising if those sections of the community who ask themselves nothing were visited by `visions,' by a widespread myth seriously believed in by some and rejected as absurd by others."--C. G. Jung, in <i>Flying Saucers</i></p><p>Jung's primary concern in <i>Flying Saucers</i> is not with the reality or unreality of UFOs but with their psychic aspect. Rather than speculate about their possible nature and extraterrestrial origin as alleged spacecraft, he asks what it may signify that these phenomena, whether real or imagined, are seen in such numbers just at a time when humankind is menaced as never before in history. The UFOs represent, in Jung's phrase, "a modern myth."</p></p><p>While Jung is known mainly for his theories on the nature of the unconscious mind, he did have an interest in the paranormal. In this essay, Jung applies his analytical skills to the UFO phenomenon. Rather than assuming that the modern prevalence of UFO sightings are due to extraterrestrial craft, Jung reserves judgment on their origin and connects UFOs with archetypal imagery, concluding that they have become a &#34;living myth.&#34; This essay is intriguing in its methodology and implications as to the nature of UFOs and their relation to the human psyche.Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>Stranger at the Pentagon by Stranges, Frank E.

But it is often forgotten that the life of the first Tudor queen, Elizabeth of York, Henry&#x2019;s mother and Elizabeth&#x2019;s grandmother, spanned one of England&#x2019;s most dramatic and perilous periods. Now <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author and acclaimed historian Alison Weir presents the first modern biography of this extraordinary woman, whose very existence united the realm and ensured the survival of the Plantagenet bloodline.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her birth was greeted with as much pomp and ceremony as that of a male heir. The first child of King Edward IV, Elizabeth enjoyed all the glittering trappings of royalty. But after the death of her father; the disappearance and probable murder of her brothers&#x2014;the Princes in the Tower; and the usurpation of the throne by her calculating uncle Richard III, Elizabeth found her world turned upside-down: She and her siblings were declared bastards.<br> &nbsp;<br> As Richard&#x2019;s wife, Anne Neville, was dying, there were murmurs that the king sought to marry his niece Elizabeth, knowing that most people believed her to be England&#x2019;s rightful queen. Weir addresses Elizabeth&#x2019;s possible role in this and her covert support for Henry Tudor, the exiled pretender who defeated Richard at the Battle of Bosworth and was crowned Henry VII, first sovereign of the House of Tudor. Elizabeth&#x2019;s subsequent marriage to Henry united the houses of York and Lancaster and signaled the end of the Wars of the Roses. For centuries historians have asserted that, as queen, she was kept under Henry&#x2019;s firm grasp, but Weir shows that Elizabeth proved to be a model consort&#x2014;pious and generous&#x2014;who enjoyed the confidence of her husband, exerted a tangible and beneficial influence, and was revered by her son, the future King Henry VIII. <br> &nbsp;<br> Drawing from a rich trove of historical records, Weir gives a long overdue and much-deserved look at this unforgettable princess whose line descends to today&#x2019;s British monarch&#x2014;a woman who overcame tragedy and danger to become one of England&#x2019;s most beloved consorts.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Elizabeth of York</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;Weir tells Elizabeth&#x2019;s story well. . . .

She lives in Surrey, England, with her husband.1<br><br>&#x201c;The Most Illustrious Maid of York&#x201d;<br><br>The royal palace of Westminster extended along the Thames shore, southwest of the City of London. A royal residence had stood on this site opposite Westminster Abbey since the sainted King Edward the Confessor had rebuilt both in the eleventh century, and the magnificent Westminster Hall had been completed by William II in 1099; in the late fourteenth century, Richard II increased the height of its walls and added the splendid oak hammer-beam roof. The sprawling palace in which the Queen was to be confined was the work of successive medieval kings, and the chief seat of royal government until much of it was destroyed by fire in 1512. Parliament often met within its walls, usually in the Painted Chamber, the White Hall, or St. Stephen&#x2019;s Chapel. Westminster Hall was used for state occasions and ceremonies, and also for coronation banquets. Daily, it was a hive of industry, housing the busy law courts and stalls selling books and other goods.<br><br>The rambling old palace was much in need of upgrading, and Edward IV had set about converting part of it into new royal lodgings, which Elizabeth of York would come to know very well. They included a privy kitchen for the preparation of royal meals, a wardrobe for the storage of royal possessions, and something very traditional in royal domestic arrangements: separate ranges of private apartments for the King and Queen.<br><br>The creation of a new &#x201c;Queen&#x2019;s side&#x201d; for Elizabeth Wyde�ville, which was begun in 1464, may have come about because the King&#x2019;s mother, the disapproving Cecily Neville, was living at court and appropriate accommodation was needed for both ladies. The apartments built for Queen Elizabeth included a withdrawing chamber and wardrobe; a great chamber would be added in 1482.1 It was in these new lodgings that the Queen was to bear her child.<br><br>For married women in those days, pregnancy was often an annual event, with all the risks it entailed. Contraception was rudimentary and would not have been practiced by royal couples, for whom a large family meant sons to secure the succession and daughters to forge political marriage alliances. It was a son, naturally, that the King wanted, and although, by medieval custom, male physicians did not attend pregnant women, Dr. Dominic de Sirego, Elizabeth Wyde�ville&#x2019;s physician, was determined to &#x201c;be the first that should bring tidings to the King of the birth of the prince,&#x201d; for messengers conveying such glad news often received &#x201c;great thanks and reward.&#x201d; Only women were allowed into the birth chamber, so when the Queen went into labor, Dr. Sirego had perforce to wait in the &#x201c;second chamber.&#x201d; The baby was a girl: &#x201c;this year [1466], the eleventh day of the month of February, was Elizabeth, first child of King Edward, born at Westminster.&#x201d;2 She was the first princess born to an English monarch in over a century.<br><br>The waiting physician, hearing the child cry, &#x201c;knocked or called secretly at the chamber door&#x201d; and asked &#x201c;what the Queen had,&#x201d; whereupon her attendants, much amused, called back, &#x201c;Whatsoever the Queen&#x2019;s Grace hath here within, sure it is that a fool standeth there without!&#x201d; Whereupon Dr. Sirego hastily &#x201c;departed without seeing the King that time.&#x201d;3<br><br>That same month, &#x201c;my Lady Princess&#x201d; was baptized &#x201c;with most solemnity&#x201d; in a new font set up in St. Stephen&#x2019;s Chapel in Westminster Palace by her kinsman, George Neville, Archbishop of York,4 just as if she had been the desired prince. She was given her mother&#x2019;s name; it was a happy coincidence that the Queen had a special devotion for St. Elizabeth.5 The name Elizabeth was not new in the royal line: it had been given to daughters of Henry I and Edward I, and to a granddaughter of Edward III. It had also been borne by Elizabeth de Burgh, the heiress who married Lionel of Antwerp, Duke of Clarence (Edward III&#x2019;s second son), and brought the rich Ulster inheritance to the royal House of York.<br><br>Tradition decreed that the King and Queen did not attend the christening, but Edward IV made it the occasion for a show of solidarity, even though the players were privately at odds or disapproved of his marriage. The baby princess&#x2019;s sponsors were her grandmothers, the Duchesses of York and Bedford, and the Earl of Warwick. Walter Blount, Lord Mountjoy, Treasurer of England, received 1,000 marks [�152,250] for his diligence at the baptism, then was promptly told to resign his office to the Queen&#x2019;s father, Lord Rivers.<br><br>The King bought his wife a jeweled ornament costing �125 [�62,550] &#x201c;against the birth of our most dear daughter Elizabeth.&#x201d; Even though she had only borne a daughter, Elizabeth Wyde�ville&#x2019;s churching ceremony that followed in late March was attended by great magnificence. The Queen left her childbed that morning and went to church in stately order, accompanied by many priests bearing relics and by many scholars singing and carrying lights. There followed a great company of ladies and maidens from the country and from London. Then came trumpeters, pipers, and players of stringed instruments. The King&#x2019;s choir followed, forty-two of them, who sang excellently. Then came twenty-four heralds and pursuivants, followed by sixty earls and knights. At last came the Queen, escorted by two dukes. Above her was a canopy. Behind her were her mother and maidens and ladies to the number of sixty. Then the Queen heard the singing of an office. Following the service of purification that marked her return to society after her confinement, &#x201c;she returned to the palace in procession, as before. Then all who had joined the procession remained to eat.&#x201d; So many guests were present&#x2014;clearly a prince had been anticipated&#x2014;that they &#x201c;filled four great rooms&#x201d; of an &#x201c;unbelievably costly apartment.&#x201d;6<br><br>Elizabeth Wyde�ville might have been deemed an unsuitable bride for the King, but she was determined that no one should remember it, and the etiquette that surrounded her on this occasion was rigorous. &#x201c;The Queen sat alone at table on a costly golden chair. The Queen&#x2019;s mother and the King&#x2019;s sister [Anne, Duchess of Exeter] had to stand some distance away. When the Queen spoke with her mother or the King&#x2019;s sister, they knelt down before her until she had drunk water. Not until the first dish was set before the Queen could [they] be seated. The [sixty] ladies and maidens and all who served the Queen at table were of noble birth, and had to kneel so long as the Queen was eating; the meal lasted for three hours. The food which was served to the Queen, the Queen&#x2019;s mother, the King&#x2019;s sister, and others was most costly. Everyone was silent and not a word was spoken.&#x201d; Afterward, no doubt to everyone&#x2019;s relief, there was dancing, with the ladies curtseying elegantly to the silent Queen, and glorious singing by the King&#x2019;s choristers. A foreign observer noted: &#x201c;The courtly reverence paid to the Queen was such as I have never seen elsewhere.&#x201d;7<br><br>Like all babies in those days, the infant princess was swaddled in tight bands with a close-fitting cap on her head, and she would have remained swaddled for the first eight or nine months of her life to ensure that her limbs grew straight. She was assigned a stately household that included a nurse (each of the royal children had a separate nurse) and a wet nurse, for queens did not suckle their children. The household was under the charge of a lady mistress, or governess, Margaret, Lady Berners,8 who received a salary of �100 [�50,000]. Under her were pages of the chamber, a &#x201c;knight of the trencher,&#x201d; and rockers to watch over the princess in her cradle.<br><br>The kingdom into which Elizabeth of York was born was a land of prosperity, according to an Italian observer writing in 1500: &#x201c;The riches of England are greater than those of any other country in Europe. This is owing, in the first place, to the great fertility of the soil, which is such that, with the exception of wine, they import nothing from abroad for their subsistence.&#x201d; The export of tin brought large sums into the realm, &#x201c;but still more do they derive from their extraordinary abundance of wool. And everyone who makes a tour in the island will soon become aware of this great wealth, for there is no small innkeeper, however poor and humble he may be, who does not serve his table with silver dishes and drinking cups, and no one who has not in his house silver plate to the amount of �100 [�50,000]. But above all are their riches displayed in the church treasures . . . You may therefore imagine what the decorations of these enormously rich Benedictine, Carthusian, and Cistercian monasteries must be. These are, indeed, more like baronial palaces than religious houses.&#x201d;9 And all, of course, would be swept away within seventy years of Elizabeth&#x2019;s birth, on the orders of her son. But for now, England was celebrated as &#x201c;the ringing isle&#x201d; because of its many churches, abbeys, and priories.<br><br>Much more of the land was covered by forest and woodland than it is now. The country was largely rural and given over to agriculture; as the Italian perceived, it had become prosperous through the export of wool and, latterly, woolen cloth. The people were often turbulent, unruly, and vociferous&#x2014;especially when it came to new taxes&#x2014;and it was said that while the French vice was lechery, the English vice was treachery. The latter were perceived to be lazy&#x2014;&#x201c;it is received as a prescript that they should sweat by no means&#x201d;&#x2014;and gluttonous: &#x201c;though they live in hovels, they eat like lords.&#x201d; Most people lived in the country, and society was generally localized. It was the upper classes and merchants who traveled.<br><br>Elizabeth would have learned early in life that she was a very special little girl. Her father was the King, whose person was regarded as sacred. Divinely appointed to rule, he had been invested at his coronation with a sanctity that set him apart from ordinary mortals and bestowed on him the grace to govern with a wisdom denied to others. The royal prerogative was believed to be the will of God working through the will of the King.<br><br>The court over which King Edward presided, and in which Elizabeth grew up, was a magnificent one&#x2014;&#x201c;the most splendid court that could be found in all Christendom.&#x201d;10 The royal family was its central focus, so Elizabeth would have grown up with a sense of her importance in the world. It would have seemed a crowded world to a young child&#x2014;Edward IV&#x2019;s household numbered about eight hundred persons or more, not counting the members of his queen&#x2019;s separate establishment. The court was itinerant, with the King dividing his time between a dozen of his palaces (most of them in the Thames Valley), according to the demands of state, the hunting to be had, or the need for cleansing a house after hundreds of courtiers and servants had tested its capacity for drainage to the limits.<br><br>Elizabeth would have become used to travel from infancy. The royal household would regularly wend its cumbersome way about the country, taking with it a long train of servants, carts, and packhorses laden with furniture, tapestries, personal belongings, and state papers, all packed in chests, coffers, and bags. The royal women and children traveled either by barge&#x2014;the Thames being the main highway through London&#x2014;or in covered horse-drawn coaches, like wagons, with four wheels, which could not have been very comfortable, as they were unsprung; or in smaller versions called litters, chariots, or &#x201c;chairs.&#x201d; A household could travel an average of twenty-six miles a day, depending on the state of the roads. Most were little more than tracks, with a few surviving Roman exceptions, and their condition depended on the weather and the public-spiritedness of the parish authorities or landowners who were supposed to maintain them. It was for this reason that royalty often preferred, where possible, to travel by river.<br><br>In his tastes, King Edward followed the dictates of the court of Burgundy, which at that time led the rest of northern Europe in art, architecture, style, dress, manners, and court ceremonial. He understood the value of magnificence that underpinned Burgundian court culture, and spent lavishly on clothing, jewels, plate, and tapestries from the Low Countries, but it was not until later in his reign that he was able to patronize the arts and indulge his passion for building. Today, the Perpendicular-style glory of St. George&#x2019;s Chapel, Windsor, and the great hall at Eltham Palace, bear witness to the largely vanished splendors of his reign.<br><br>Elizabeth grew up to know these places well, especially the Palace of Westminster. Opposite stood Westminster Abbey, where kings were crowned and many of her royal forebears were buried. Elizabeth would have grown up knowing the neighboring City of London well too. &#x201c;All the beauty of this island is confined to London,&#x201d; wrote the anonymous Italian in 1500.11 It was one of the greatest cities in Christendom, prosperous and teeming, its skyline dominated by the soaring Gothic edifice of St. Paul&#x2019;s Cathedral and the spires of over eighty churches. About 60,000 to 75,000 of England&#x2019;s estimated population of three or four million people lived in the City, which possessed &#x201c;all the advantages to be desired in a maritime town&#x201d; and was a flourishing mercantile center. &#x201c;On the banks of the Thames are enormous warehouses for imported goods; also numerous cranes of remarkable size to unload merchandise from ships . . . Whatever there is in the City, it all belongs to craftsmen and merchants,&#x201d;12 such as would supply Elizabeth with luxury goods all her life.</p><h2>Hawthorne: A Life</h2><p>Handsome, reserved, almost frighteningly aloof until he was approached, then playful, cordial, Nathaniel Hawthorne was as mercurial and double-edged as his writing. &#x201c;Deep as Dante,&#x201d; Herman Melville said. <br><br>Hawthorne himself declared that he was not &#x201c;one of those supremely hospitable people who serve up their own hearts, delicately fried, with brain sauce, as a tidbit&#x201d; for the public. Yet those who knew him best often took the opposite position. &#x201c;He always puts himself in his books,&#x201d; said his sister-in-law Mary Mann, &#x201c;he cannot help it.&#x201d; His life, like his work, was extraordinary, a play of light and shadow.<br><br>In this major new biography of Hawthorne, the first in more than a decade, Brenda Wineapple, acclaimed biographer of Janet Flanner and Gertrude and Leo Stein (&#x201c;Luminous&#x201d;&#x2013;Richard Howard), brings him brilliantly alive: an exquisite writer who shoveled dung in an attempt to found a new utopia at Brook Farm and then excoriated the community (or his attraction to it) in caustic satire; the confidant of Franklin Pierce, fourteenth president of the United States and arguably one of its worst; friend to Emerson and Thoreau and Melville who, unlike them, made fun of Abraham Lincoln and who, also unlike them, wrote compellingly of women, deeply identifying with them&#x2013;he was the first major American writer to create erotic female characters. Those vibrant, independent women continue to haunt the imagination, although Hawthorne often punishes, humiliates, or kills them, as if exorcising that which enthralls. <br><br>Here is the man rooted in Salem, Massachusetts, of an old pre-Revolutionary family, reared partly in the wilds of western Maine, then schooled along with Longfellow at Bowdoin College. Here are his idyllic marriage to the youngest and prettiest of the Peabody sisters and his longtime friendships, including with Margaret Fuller, the notorious feminist writer and intellectual.<br><br>Here too is Hawthorne at the end of his days, revered as a genius, but considered as well to be an embarrassing puzzle by the Boston intelligentsia, isolated by fiercely held political loyalties that placed him against the Civil War and the currents of his time.<br><br>Brenda Wineapple navigates the high tides and chill undercurrents of Hawthorne&#x2019;s fascinating life and work with clarity, nuance, and insight. The novels and tales, the incidental writings, travel notes and children&#x2019;s books, letters and diaries reverberate in this biography, which both charts and protects the dark unknowable core that is quintessentially Hawthorne. In him, the quest of his generation for an authentically American voice bears disquieting fruit.</p><p>&nbsp;&#x201c;Clearly the best biography of Hawthorne; <i>the</i> Hawthorne for our time. Beautifully conceived and written, it conveys the full poignancy and complexity of Hawthorne&#x2019;s life; it makes vivid the times and people and places &#x2014; and what a rich array of people and events! A delight to read from start to end.&#x201d;<br><br>--Sacvan Bercovitch<br><br>&#x201c;Brenda Wineapple&#x2019;s Hawthorne is, quite literally, an electrifying life. The power and sweep of the writing galvanizes a subject frozen, by earlier biographies, into a series of stills. We understand, finally, a man and artist torn by every conflict of his time, adding a few of his own, a man both strange and strangely familiar. The great achievement of this stunning biography lies in the feat of restoring Hawthorne to the rich and roiling America of his own period, while revealing him, for the first time, as our contemporary.&#x201d;<br><br>--Benita Eisler<br><br>&#x201c;With the possible exception of Herman Melville, no one has ever understood the grand tragic Shakespearian nature of Nathaniel Hawthorne's life and work as well as Brenda Wineapple. Her brilliant, powerful, nervy, unsettling and riveting book is authoritatively researched and beautifully written; it has itself the dark mesmeric power of a Hawthorne story. Wineapple's Hawthorne is an intensely private man, compounded of strange depths, mysterious failings, concealments, yearnings and unmistakable incandescent genius.&#x201d;<br> <br>--Robert D. Richardson<br><br>&#x201c;Brenda Wineapple illuminates Hawthorne's complexities without demystifying the man. He remains one of the most intriguing American writers: dark, guilty, erotic, and psychologically acute &#x2013; qualities that Wineapple deftly explores.&#x201d;<br><br>--Margot Peters<br><br>&#x201c;There is no justice for Hawthorne without the mercy which failed him in life and art. In Wineapple's new dispensation, all the man endured and the art achieved is revealed by loving scruple and, to awful circumstance, condolent response. No biographer since James, no critic since Lawrence has limned so unsparing and therefore so speaking a likeness of our first great fabulist, from which one returns to the works with enlightened wonder. More darkness, more light! Here both abound.&#x201d;<br><br>--Richard Howard<br>&#x201c;A fine biography...A sensitive reading of Hawthorne&#x2019;s character...Wineapple makes generous use of a cache of family letters that detail the tangle and tussle of wills that Hawthorne had entered as son, brother, lover, and husband, all the while seeking the freedom of spirit to exercise his genius.&#x201d;<br><br>--Justin Kaplan, <i>Washington Post<br></i><br>&#x201c;Meticulously researched and superbly written...captures the novelist in high resolution.&#x201d;<br><br>--Peter Campion, <i>San Francisco Chronicle<br></i><br><br>&#x201c;A vivid account of a highly interesting life.&#x201d;<br><br>--Brooke Allen, <i>New York Times Book Review<br></i><br><br>&#x201c;Richly detailed and nuanced; a model of literary biography and an illumination for students of Hawthorne&#x2019;s work...A thoughtful and absorbing life.&#x201d;<br><br>--<i>Kirkus (starred)<br></i><br><br>&#x201c;A thoroughly engrossing story of a writer's life... written with novelistic grace and flow, with an eye to the telling detail and apt quotation.&#x201d; <br><br>--Dan Cryer, <i>New York</i> <i>Newsday</i><br>&#x201c;Wineapple is a splendid stylist and a master of concision.

Surely these noble tubers have long deserved some sort of epic treatment (one wonders, for instance, why there's never been a "Charge of the Spud Brigade" or "The Tater Not Taken"), but <i>Brave Potatoes</i> at last gives the forsaken roots their well-deserved due, in a wonderfully weird and lyrical tribute.<p> Squeezed in between the prize perennials and the summer squash at a county fair 4-H hall, the potatoes begin their night of adventure, rubbing their eyes as they stir to life. "Everyone's asleep in the Bud and Bean Arena. / So all the prize potatoes with their eyes wide open topple to the hard-knocky floor." This lumpy little crew has just one thing in mind: heading down the midway to take a ride on the Zip. "Over at the Fair, / potatoes in the air! / See them flip, flip, flip on the wild and woolly Zip!" But across town at the Chowder Lounge, Chef Hackemup has other plans for these high-flying potatoes--hoping to make curly fries, chips, and gumbo � la Zip, "Off goes / Hackemup / with a bag / to pack 'em up." Can these spuds possibly survive his shredder and his grater and his So-Long-See-You-Later? Only if they're brave enough, of course, and you can bet that all the other vegetables held captive in Hackemup's mad-scientist-style kitchen are counting on them.</p><p> Speed's well-crafted verse ("If real words won't do, I make some up," he admits) is matched only by Root's luminescent and hilariously detailed illustrations. (Ages 7 to 10) <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>The team behind Two Cool Cows returns in this remarkable veggie opera. After dark at the county fair's produce display, strange things are afoot: "All the prize potatoes with their eyes wide open/ topple to the hard-knocky floor/ and one potato, two potato, three potato, four/ head for the creak-cracky door." As complacent pumpkins and watermelons snooze, the spuds gallop into the moonlight and climb aboard a carnival ride, the Zip (whose name conveniently rhymes with "chip"). Meanwhile, in a nearby industrial kitchen full of steaming, gleaming copper kettles, Hackemup the chef whacks unfortunate onions, peppers and tomatoesA"But he hasn't got potatoes./ No, he hasn't got potatoes." Speed sets up a wicked confrontation between Hackemup and the innocent tubers, and the aptly named Root paints the midnight showdown with gusto. The collaborators present the unusual material without irony, and Root carefully portrays the russet red and Yukon gold heroes in all sizes, with unique personalities blazing in their beady little eyes. The intrepid potatoes stage a real grassroots campaign against The Man, and they ultimately march down the street chanting, "We will never be potpie./ We will never be potluck./ We will never be frittata./ We will always be potatoes." This poetically phrased and oddly poignant tale might make a good companion to Saxton Freymann and Joost Elffers's How Are You Peeling?, another omen of a budding potato-liberation movement.

The book has been edgily compiled (and written and contributed to) by Lynne Perrella, whose skill in bringing together large and diverse communities of artists to create to particular themes is renowned. Most of the "paper dolls" in this book, while occasionally paper, and in general, loosely fitting the definition of doll, push the envelope in ways that will inspire and delight anyone with even a passing interest in the human figure as art. Vivacious and luscious colors and textures abound - the photographs of each artists' project(s) almost jump off the page - just short of 3-d. From Michelle Ward's fashionable Zelda Fitzgerald - complete with playing cards - to Deb Trotter's Buffalo Bill Cody shrine, the art created for this book shimmers and pulses with personalities, of the author, the artists and their subjects. I would be remiss to not give a nod of approval to the design and production of this nice thick volume. The backgrounds stand on their own, the quotes and typography add additional interest, and the layout, while easy on the eyes, is never static." --S.

Lynne Perrella's gorgeous paperdoll-assemblage on the cover of Beyond Paper Dolls is a colorful invitation into this beautiful volume. Given the opportunity to create their vision of a "paper doll", over 50 top artists let their imaginations run totally wild. Every page is populated with glorious creatures fashioned from materials as diverse as a vintage fly swatter to gilded leather antique book covers and their pages. This is a hefty book at almost 200 pages and every single one is stunningly styled and photographed in full color. I really appreciated the Details Dossier feature of this book--interesting elements from each doll were singled out and special focus was given to technique and inspiration with a close up photo as a helpful visual. Lynne Perrella is simply one of the best writers around. Her insightful intros (graced with her own astonishing artwork) and commentary for these dolls add depth and playful dimension to each one.

For weeks the nobility of Great Britain had been terrified&#x2014;particularly the gentlemen. More than usual had fled to the country to their family homes, and those who hadn't family seats had gone with those who had to hunt and have lavish parties. They thought they were safe away from London, but they weren't. There'd been three murders outside of the city over the past month&#x2014;two in Derbyshire, and one in Leicestershire. All three had happened at house parties where the guest lists contained almost exactly the same names. Two more deaths had happened in London, also at parties.<br><br>The victims were all men and they had all been burned to death. From the <em>inside.</em> That fact made the murders odd enough that Her Majesty Queen Victoria had requested that Griffin King, Duke of Greythorne, investigate. The only clue Griffin had to go on were two loose pearls found at the scene of one of the Derbyshire murders. Based on that scant evidence, the press had decided the killer was a woman, and dubbed her "Lady Ash" because ash was exactly that to which her victims were reduced.<br><br>Griffin had a particular dislike for the press but unfortunately they seemed to be correct. It seemed the killer was indeed a woman, but who? And why?<br><br>"I've never seen people madder than the aristocracy," Finley Jayne remarked as she lounged on the sofa in the library of King House, nibbling on shortbread. An audio cylinder of Beethoven played softly in the background. "Excluding you, of course."<br><br>He smiled at her. "Of course." Griffin treasured these quiet moments when it was just the two of them doing mundane things. True, they were trying to catch a criminal, but tea and biscuits made it seem normal. Any moment now he expected someone to come barging in, but for the time being he was content&#x2014;a feeling he rarely experienced anymore.<br><br>He wasn't an idiot. He knew that he had to confide in Finley that The Machinist, Leonardo Garibaldi, was haunting him. Everyone had expected something of that nature to occur after the villain had died. Even from beyond the grave, Garibaldi was hell-bent on destroying Griffin and everything he held dear. The Machinist gave him no rest. He'd appear at any time of day, during any sort of function. Sometimes Griffin could send him back to the Aether, or ignore him, but other times...<br><br>Garibaldi was getting stronger. Very strong. Being dead had only made it easier for him to harness Aethe-ric energy and use it for his own dark purposes. Soon, the ghost would make his move, but with any luck not until they found and apprehended Lady Ash.<br><br>What would happen when Garibaldi came for him was anyone's guess. Griffin worked on strengthening his own abilities, but it felt more draining than empowering. He was tired all the time, and all he wanted was to commit Finley's smile to memory&#x2014;just in case. He wasn't being maudlin, just prepared. Death didn't frighten him, but imagining all the things Garibaldi might have in store for him before and after...well, that was disconcerting. Still, he wasn't about to go without a fight, and even if Garibaldi did his worst, Griffin would find a way out&#x2014;and defeat his nemesis.<br><br>He reached out from where he sat on the sofa beside Finley and stroked a lock of black that ran through her honey-blond hair. It had appeared shortly after they'd amalgamated the two sides of her Aetheric self. She'd rather been like that Jekyll and Hyde character before, though much prettier.<br><br>She glanced at him, amber eyes troubled. "What?"<br><br>He shook his head. "Nothing. Just wanted to touch you."<br><br>She snuggled closer. "You can touch me whenever you like."<br><br>"That's an interesting invitation," he murmured, trailing his fingers down her neck. She was wearing a violet frock with long sleeves under a black leather corset. Even though he'd helped lace the corset that very morning, there was something tantalizing about possibly getting her out of it____He pressed his lips to her throat.<br><br>The door to the library burst open.<br><br>Finley swore. Griffin chuckled. Of course the others would choose this moment to show up. Their timing was, as always, terrible.<br><br>They filed in one after the other&#x2014;Emily in front, followed by Sam, Wildcat and Jasper. A motley bunch if ever there was one. Emily carried a stack of papers, and had that expression on her freckled face that said she believed she'd solved a puzzle. Griffin loved to see that look.<br><br>"What did you find?" he asked as Finley sat up, putting a little distance between them. He wanted to pull her back, but she wasn't much for flaunting their relationship in front of other people, even their friends.<br><br>Emily flopped down in a nearby chair, spreading the papers out on the tea table. "Lady Ash, I think."<br><br>Sam snatched a shortbread from the plate and shoved the entire biscuit in his mouth. "She's a genius."<br><br>It always amazed Griffin to watch Sam eat. His friend loved food so much that somehow he managed to talk without spraying crumbs&#x2014;as though his mouth knew better than to waste them by spitting them out.<br><br>"That goes without saying," Griffin agreed.<br><br>"Just let her speak, will you?" Finley was peevish&#x2014;and it was obvious. Griffin patted her thigh. He'd make certain they had some time alone later.<br><br>Emily arched an eyebrow at the other girl's tone and Wildcat and Jasper shared a glance. Maybe Griffin should speak to the cowboy and ask him how he managed to find time to sneak away with Cat. They never seemed to have a problem spending time together. In fact, there had been times when they'd been impossible to find. People always seemed to find <em>him.</em><br><br>"I used the Aether engine to compile a list of possible suspects," Emily informed them in her Irish lilt. "I compared the guest list to all the gatherings with the Scotland Yard accounts of recently reported burglaries."<br><br>Finley frowned. "But Lady Ash hasn't stolen anything. Has she?"<br><br>Emily grinned, seemingly unaware of just how foul the other girl's mood was. "No, but I reckoned she might be intelligent enough to realize someone would look into her ruined pearls. Two aristocratic women reported having pearls stolen as of late, but only one was invited to&#x2014;and attended&#x2014;each of the parties."<br><br>They all stared at her&#x2014;waiting. She sat there, smiling at them as tension built.<br><br>"Emily," Finley growled. "Just tell us who the bloody hell she is."<br><br>"She's in an ugly mood, Em," Sam added. "Best not to poke too much."<br><br>The little Irish girl sighed. "I stayed up all night compiling this data&#x2014;the least you all can do is allow me to bask in my success."<br><br>"Bask later." Finley sounded as though her jaw was glued shut. Griffin hid a smile. It was cruel of him&#x2014;childish even, but how could he not love knowing that she was so sour because they'd been interrupted?<br><br>"Just tell us, Em," he urged. "And then we can praise your hard work and genius."<br><br>That seemed to appease her. She lit up like Guy Fawkes Night. "Lady Grantfarthen."<br><br>Grantfarthen. It wasn't a title Griffin knew well, but then, he wasn't exactly a social butterfly. As a young noble, especially a duke, he was a person that many sought to know, curry favor from or shove their daughters at. He had more important things to do than dance and drink champagne. Although, perhaps if he'd done a little more of that, his life wouldn't always seem to be in peril.<br><br>"Her husband was a viscount," Emily went on. "They spent most of their time at their country estate in Lincolnshire until Lord Grantfarthen shot himself over gaming debts, and the new heir tossed Lady Grantfarthen out."<br><br>The new lord must be quite the peach indeed. "Let me guess. The victims have all been people to whom the late viscount owed money?" It wasn't a brilliant deduction, so Griffin didn't pat his own back over it.<br><br>Emily nodded. "Two of them had called in their markers, as well. When Grantfarthen couldn't pay, they threatened to ruin him publicly."<br><br>It was enough to make Griffin ashamed of the society into which he'd been born. If the thought of ridicule was enough to make you eat a bullet, what sort of world did you live in? Not a very pleasant one. "So the widow uses her abilities for a little revenge and claims her necklace was stolen to cover her tracks."<br><br>"She's not stupid," Wildcat commented. "Would have been smarter not to wear the pearls at all, though."<br><br>"Appearances," Griffin said, absently. "One must keep up appearances. Not wearing the pearls might make people speculate that she'd taken to selling off her jewelry. Did you look into the lady's finances?"<br><br>Emily puffed up like a little bird. "On a whim, I did. Turns out she had her own fortune as her father's only child, but her da had put a stipulation on her dowry that Lord Grantfarthen couldn't have access to it without written permission from his wife and his father-in-law. The old man's in trade apparently, and rich as Midas. He refused to sign over any money, but he did offer his son-in-law a loan."<br><br>"Which he refused," Griffin concluded with a grimace. For many men&#x2014;especially titled ones&#x2014;pride was a terrible thing. Having a man "beneath" him deny him what he saw as rightfully his must have driven the viscount to distraction. "Do we know where the father is now?"<br><br>Emily consulted her papers. "I have an address for Mr. Peabody in Cheapside. He's been out of the country, though."<br><br>"When's he due back?"<br><br>She looked again. "This morning. What are you thinking, lad?"<br><br>Griffin smiled without humor. "I'm thinking that our fiery lady might decide to pay a visit to her papa. She might decide she's had enough of him controlling her money&#x2014;and she might want his, as well."<br><br>Some of the color left Emily's cheeks. She was already very pale. "You don't think she'd kill her own father?"<br><br>"I think she's insane, very powerful and drunk on the fact that she's gotten away with it for this long. I also think we'd better make haste to Cheapside if we're to save Mr. Peabody from a grisly death." He rose to his feet and offered Finley his hand. "Let's go."<br><br>Her fingers entwined with his as she rose to her feet. She wasn't happy, he could tell&#x2014;and he didn't blame her. Since they'd met, their lives had been one adventure after another. Some of it had been fun, but most of it had been dangerous. They could use a little quiet time together. He wanted to give her that, but not at the expense of a life&#x2014;especially not when it was a life they could save.<br><br>"We'll go away after," he told her in a low voice. "Spend some time alone."<br><br>She shot him a doubtful glance. "All right." But there was no conviction in her tone. She pulled her hand free of his and walked toward the door.<br><br>"I don't blame her," whispered a voice near his ear.<br><br><em>Garibaldi.</em> Griffin didn't turn his head. Didn't even acknowledge that he'd heard. No one else seemed to have either.<br><br>"She knows you don't mean it, Your Grace. More importantly, <em>you</em> know you don't mean it."<br><br>Griffin's jaw tightened, but he remained silent. Clenching his hands into fists, he followed his friends.<br><br>The Machinist chuckled&#x2014;the sound echoing in his head.<br><br>"I'm coming for you, Griffin King."</p><h2>Minor Apocalypse</h2><p>As in his novel The Polish Complex, Konwicki&#39;s A Minor Apocalypse stars a narrator and character named Konwicki, who has been asked to set himself on fire that evening in front of the Communist Party headquarters in Warsaw in an act of protest.

Insurance companies now often try to delay payment of justified claims, deny payment altogether, and defend these actions by forcing claimants to enter litigation.<br><br> Jay M. Feinman, a legal scholar and insurance expert, explains how these trends developed, how the government ought to fix the system, and what the rest of us can do to protect ourselves. He shows that the denial of valid claims is not occasional or accidental or the fault of a few bad employees. It's the result of an increasing and systematic focus on maximizing profits by major companies such as Allstate and State Farm.<br><br> Citing dozens of stories of victims who were unfairly denied payment, Feinman explains how people can be more cautious when shopping for policies and what to do when pursuing a disputed claim. He also lays out a plan for the legal reforms needed to prevent future abuses. This expos� will help drive the discussion of this increasingly hot- button issue.<br><br></p><p><b>Jay M.

Homeless as a teenager, he credited his discovery of cooking with turning his life around. He grew up in Portland, Oregon and graduated from Le Cordon Bleu. He then worked his way up the ranks in nearly 50 kitchens on the West Coast before moving to Chicago to work at Charlie Trotter&#39;s restaurant before leaving to open Moto. Cantu passed away suddenly in 2015."Cantu is an international leader in molecular gastronomy-he is equal parts artist and mad scientist. Using science and technology, he is challenging the very definition of what is, and what isn't, food... The mind-bending dishes he is serving today could change what you eat tomorrow."&#x2015;<b><i><i>CNN</i>'s <i>The Next List</i></i></b><br><br>"While Cantu is most certainly a chef, he is also someone whose approach to innovation has relevance far beyond the kitchen."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Fast Company</i></i></b><br><br>"Cantu was known nationally as a chef who incorporated his playful personality and the thrill of science into the menu at his high-end... restaurant Moto.... Cantu wowed diners with edible menus, carbonated fruit and a fish preparation that cooked before your eyes in a tabletop polymer box, but his ambitions went beyond culinary pleasures.... Cantu presented food and science as a way to solve the world's problems, particularly hunger."&#x2015;<b><i><i>The Chicago Tribune</i></i></b><br><br>"Homaro Cantu is the creative force behind Chicago's molecular gastronomy hot spot Moto and Cantu Designs, a future-focused firm where his team work on wildly varying food-related projects....[his] inventions range from the mad-scientist realm... to humanitarian efforts directed at issues as monumental as world hunger."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Gourmet</i></i></b><br><br>"Cantu [had a] trailblazing, futuristic style [that] earned him accolades for his restaurants...[and] actively embraced technology in the kitchen."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Eater</i></i></b><br><br>"Homaro Cantu's skill in the kitchen and creative spirit helped to make Chicago the culinary capital it is today."&#x2015;<b><i>Office of the Mayor of Chicago</i></b><br><br>"Homaro Cantu wasn't a cook, he was an artist, an inventor, a mad genius.

For a hundred years, the Predators, sadistic extraterrestrial hunters, have been a dim memory. For a hundred years, we&#39;ve been safe. That ends now. Cast in daylight for years at a time, the almost eternally lit jungle planet known as Midnight is the home to more than a thousand colonists, explorers building a haven on a new world.

As her organs failed, she entered into an extraordinary near-death experience where she realized her inherent worth . . . and the actual cause of her disease. Upon regaining consciousness, Anita found that her condition had improved so rapidly that she was able to be released from the hospital within weeks . . . without a trace of cancer in her body! Within these pages Anita recounts stories of her childhood in Hong Kong, her challenge to establish her career and find true love, as well as how she eventually ended up in that hospital bed where she defied all medical knowledge. As part of a traditional Hindu family residing in a largely Chinese and British society, she had been pushed and pulled by cultural and religious customs since she had been a little girl. After years of struggling to forge her own path while trying to meet everyone else&#39;s expectations, she had the realization, as a result of her epiphany on the other side, that she had the power to heal herself . . . and that there are miracles in the Universe that she had never even imagined. In Dying to Be Me, Anita freely shares all she has learned about illness, healing, fear, &#34;being love,&#34; and the true magnificence of each and every human being!</p><p>Afterword<br> Before I close, I'd like to leave you with a few final words. Always remember not to surrender your power--instead, get in touch with your own magnificence. When it comes to finding the right path, there's a different answer for each person. The only universal solution I have is to love yourself unconditionally and be yourself fearlessly! This is the most important lesson I learned from my NDE, and I honestly feel that if I'd always known this, I never would have gotten cancer in the first place. <br> When we're true to ourselves, we become instruments of truth for the planet. Because we're all connected, we touch the lives of everyone around us, who then affect others. Our only obligation is to be the love we are and allow our answers to come from within in the way that's most appropriate for us. <br><br> Finally, I can't stress enough how important it is to enjoy yourself and not take yourself or life too seriously. One of the biggest flaws with many traditional spiritual systems is that they give you such a somber outlook. Although you know that I abhor creating doctrines, if I ever had to create a set of tenets for a spiritual path to healing, number one on my list would be to make sure to laugh as often as possible throughout every single day--and preferably laugh at myself. This would be hands down over and above any form of prayer, meditation, chanting, or diet reform. Day-to-day problems never seem as big when viewed through a veil of humor and love. <br><br> In this age of information technology, we're bombarded with news seemingly at the speed of light. We're living in an age of high stress and fear, and in the midst of trying to protect ourselves from everything we think is "out there," we've forgotten to enjoy ourselves and to take care of what's inside. <br><br> Our life is our prayer. It's our gift to this universe, and the memories we leave behind when we someday exit this world will be our legacy to our loved ones. We owe it to ourselves and to everyone around us to be happy and to spread that joy around. <br><br> If we can go through life armed with humor and the realization that we are love, we'll already be ahead of the game. Add a box of good chocolates into the mix, and we've really got a winning formula! <br><br> I wish you joy as you realize your magnificence and express yourself fearlessly in the world.<br> Namaste!Anita Moorjani was born in Singapore of Indian parents, moved to Hong Kong at the age of two, and has lived in Hong Kong most of her life. Because of her background and British education, she is multilingual and grew up speaking English, Cantonese, and an Indian dialect simultaneously; she later learned French at school. Anita had been working in the corporate world for many years before being diagnosed with cancer in April 2002. Her fascinating and moving near-death experience in early 2006 tremendously changed her perspective on life, and her work is now ingrained with the depths and insights she gained while in the other realm. As a result of her near-death experience, Anita is often invited to speak at conferences and events around the globe to share her insights. She&#39;s also a frequent guest at the University of Hong Kong&#39;s department of behavioral sciences, speaking on topics such as dealing with terminal illness, facing death, and the psychology of spiritual beliefs. She is the embodiment of the truth that we all have the inner power and wisdom to overcome even life&#39;s most adverse situations, as she&#39;s the living proof of this possibility. Anita currently lives in Hong Kong with her husband, and when she&#39;s not traveling and speaking at conferences, she works as an intercultural consultant for multinational corporations based in the city.

Born in the early 1900s, he lives through multiple centuries. <i>Time Enough for Love</i> is his lovingly detailed account of his journey through a vast and magnificent timescape of centuries and worlds. Using the voice of Lazarus, Heinlein expounds his own philosophies, including his radical (for 1946) ideas on sexual freedom. His use of slang, technical jargon, sharp wit, and clever understatement lend this story a texture and authority that seems the very tone of things to come.</p><p>Robert Anson Heinlein was born in Missouri in 1907, and was raised there. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1929, but was forced by illness to retire from the Navy in 1934. He settled in California and over the next five years held a variety of jobs while doing post-graduate work in mathematics and physics at the University of California. In 1939 he sold his first science fiction story to <b>Astounding</b> magazine and soon devoted himself to the genre. <p> He was a four-time winner of the Hugo Award for his novels <b>Stranger in a Strange Land</b> (1961), <b>Starship Troopers</b> (1959), <b>Double Star</b> (1956), and <b>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</b> (1966). His <b>Future History</b> series, incorporating both short stories and novels, was first mapped out in 1941. The series charts the social, political, and technological changes shaping human society from the present through several centuries into the future. </p><p> Robert A. Heinlein's books were among the first works of science fiction to reach bestseller status in both hardcover and paperback. he continued to work into his eighties, and his work never ceased to amaze, to entertain, and to generate controversy. By the time hed died, in 1988, it was evident that he was one of the formative talents of science fiction: a writer whose unique vision, unflagging energy, and persistence, over the course of five decades, made a great impact on the American mind.</p>Sure, there's time enough for love...but who has time enough to get through 281/2 hours of a novel as dull as this? It opens 22 centuries in the future, when the ruler of a remote colony planet tries to keep 2000-year-old Lazarus Long from committing suicide before he passes on what he has learned. What follows is a very talky book, comprised mostly of Long's reminiscences. Curious about his possible blood ties to almost everyone he encounters, Long talks at length about genetics, but what he says now seems absurdly out-of-date, thanks to recent developments in DNA fingerprinting. When this book first appeared in 1973, it was hailed as one of Heinlein's masterworks the capstone to his future history cycle. Now it creaks with age, leaving listeners to marvel at how quickly the future can grow stale. Lloyd James's reading injects some life into the story but not enough to make it a worthwhile acquisition to any but well-funded sf collections. R.

Papa Spork was not a natural golfer. Among other differences, natural golfers do not acquire their socks by hijacking a lorryload destined for St. Andrews. It isn&#x2019;t done. Golf is a religion of patience. Socks come and socks go, and the wise golfer waits, sees the pair he wants, and buys it without fuss. The notion that he might put a Thompson sub-machine gun in the face of the burly Glaswegian driver, and tell him to quit the cab or adorn it . . . well. A man who does that is never going to get his handicap down below the teens. <br><br> The upside is that Joe doesn&#x2019;t think of these socks as belonging to Papa Spork. They&#x2019;re just one of two thousand pairs he inherited when his father passed on to the great bunker in the sky, contents of a lock-up off Brick Lane. He returned as much of the swag as he could&#x2014;it was a weird, motley collection, very appropriate to Papa Spork&#x2019;s somewhat eccentric life of crime&#x2014;and found himself left with several suitcases of personal effects, family Bibles and albums, some bits and bobs his father apparently stole from <i>his</i> father, and a few pairs of socks the chairman of St. Andrews suggested he keep as a memento. <br><br> &#x201c;I appreciate it can&#x2019;t have been easy, doing this,&#x201d; the chairman said over the phone. &#x201c;Old wounds and so on.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Really, I&#x2019;m just embarrassed.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Good Lord, don&#x2019;t be. Bad enough that the sins of the fathers shall descend and all that, without feeling embarrassed about it. <i>My</i> father was in Bomber Command. Helped plan the firebombing of Dresden. Can you imagine? Pinching socks is rather benign, eh?&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;I suppose so.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Dresden was during the war, of course, so I suppose they thought it had to be done. Jolly heroic, no doubt. But I&#x2019;ve seen photographs. Have you?&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;No.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Try not to, I should. They&#x2019;ll stay with you. But if ever you do, for some godforsaken reason, it might make you feel better to be wearing a pair of lurid Argyles. I&#x2019;m putting a few in a parcel. If it will salve your guilt, I shall choose the absolute nastiest ones.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Oh, yes, all right. Thank you.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;I fly myself, you know. Civilian. I used to love it, but recently I can&#x2019;t help but see firebombs falling. So I&#x2019;ve sort of given up. Rather a shame, really.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Yes, it is.&#x201d; <br><br> There&#x2019;s a pause while the chairman considers the possibility that he may have revealed rather more of himself than he had intended. <br><br> &#x201c;Right then. It&#x2019;ll be the chartreuse. I quite fancy a pair of those myself, to wear next time I visit the old bugger up at Hawley Churchyard. &#x2018;Look here, you frightful old sod,&#x2019; I shall tell him, &#x2018;where you persuaded yourself it was absolutely vital that we immolate a city full of civilians, other men&#x2019;s fathers restricted themselves to stealing ugly socks.&#x2019; That ought to show him, eh?&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;I suppose so.&#x201d; <br><br> So on his feet now are the fruits of this curious exchange, and very welcome between his unpedicured soles and the icy floor. <br><br> The leather coat, meanwhile, is a precaution against attack. He does own a dressing gown, or rather, a toweling bathrobe, but while it&#x2019;s more cosy to get into, it&#x2019;s also more vulnerable. Joe Spork inhabits a warehouse space above his workshop&#x2014;his late grandfather&#x2019;s workshop&#x2014;in a dingy, silent bit of London down by the river. The march of progress has passed it by because the views are grey and angular and the place smells strongly of riverbank, so the whole enormous building notionally belongs to him, though it is, alas, somewhat entailed to banks and lenders. Mathew&#x2014;this being the name of his lamentable dad&#x2014;had a relaxed attitude to paper debt; money was something you could always steal more of.<br><br>Speaking of debts, he wonders sometimes&#x2014;when he contemplates the high days and the dark days of his time as the heir of crime&#x2014;whether Mathew ever killed anyone. Or, indeed, whether he killed a multitude. Mobsters, after all, are given to arguing with one another in rather bloody ways, and the outcomes of these discussions are often bodies draped like wet cloth over barstools and behind the wheels of cars. Is there a secret graveyard somewhere, or a pig farm, where the consequences of his father&#x2019;s breezy amorality are left to their final rest? And if there is, what liability does his son inherit on that score? <br><br> In reality, the ground floor is entirely given over to Joe&#x2019;s workshop and saleroom. It&#x2019;s high and mysterious, with things under dust sheets and&#x2014;best of all&#x2014;wrapped in thick black plastic and taped up in the far corner &#x201c;to treat the woodworm.&#x201d; Of recent days these objects are mostly nothing more than a couple of trestles or benches arranged to look significant when buyers come by, but some are the copper-bottomed real thing&#x2014;timepieces, music boxes, and best of all: hand-made mechanical automata, painted and carved and cast when a computer was a fellow who could count without reference to his fingers. <br><br> It&#x2019;s impossible, from within, not to know where the warehouse is. The smell of old London whispers up through the damp boards of the sale room, carrying with it traces of river, silt and mulch, but by some fillip of design and aging wood it never becomes obnoxious. The light from the window slots, high above ground level and glazed with that cross-wired glass for security, falls at the moment on no fewer than five Edinburgh long-case clocks, two pianolas, and one remarkable object which is either a mechanised rocking horse or something more outr� for which Joe will have to find a rather racy sort of buyer. These grand prizes are surrounded by lesser ephemera and common-or-garden stock: crank-handle telephones, gramophones and curiosities. And there, on a plinth, is the Death Clock. <br><br> It&#x2019;s just a piece of Victorian tat, really. A looming skeleton in a cowl drives a chariot from right to left, so that&#x2014;to the western European observer, used to reading from left to right&#x2014;he is coming to meet us. He has his scythe slung conveniently across his back for easy reaping, and a scrawny steed with an evil expression pulls the thing onward, ever onward. The facing wheel is a black clock with very slender bone hands. It has no chime; the message is perhaps that time passes without punctuation, but passes all the same. Joe&#x2019;s grandfather, in his will, commended it to his heir for &#x201c;special consideration&#x201d;&#x2014;the mechanism is very clever, motivated by atmospheric fluctuation&#x2014;but the infant Joe was petrified of it, and the adolescent resented its immutable, morbid promise. Even now&#x2014;particularly now, when thirty years of age is visible in his rear-view mirror and forty glowers at him from down the road ahead, now that his skin heals a little more slowly than it used to from solder burn and nicks and pinks, and his stomach is less a washboard and more a comfy if solid bench&#x2014;Joe avoids looking at it. <br><br> The Death Clock also guards his only shameful secret, a minor, practical concession to the past and the financial necessities. In the deepest shadows of the warehouse, next to the leaky part of the wall and covered in a grimy dustsheet, are six old slot machines&#x2014;genuine one-armed bandits&#x2014;which he is refurbishing for an old acquaintance named Jorge. Jorge (&#x201c;Yooorrr-geh! With passion like Pasternak!&#x201d; he tells new acquaintances) runs a number of low dives which feature gambling and other vices as their main attractions, and Joe&#x2019;s job is to maintain these traditional machines&#x2014;which now dispense tokens for high-value amounts and intimate services rather than mere pennies&#x2014;and to bugger them systematically so that they pay out on rare occasions or according to Jorge&#x2019;s personal instruction. The price of continuity in the clockworking business is minor compromise. <br><br>The floor above&#x2014;the living area, where Joe has a bed and some old wooden wardrobes big enough to conceal a battleship&#x2014;is a beautiful space. It has broad, arched windows and mellowed red-brick walls which look out onto the river on one side, and on the other an urban landscape of stores and markets, depots and back offices, lock-ups, car dealerships, Customs pounds, and one vile square of green-grey grass which is protected by some indelible ordinance and thus must be allowed to fester where it lies. <br><br> All very fine, but the warehouse has recently acquired one serious irritant: a cat. At some time, one mooring two hundred yards up was allowed to go to a houseboat, on which lives a very sweet, very poor family called Watson. Griff and Abbie are a brace of mildly paranoid anarchists, deeply allergic to paperwork and employment on conscientious grounds. There&#x2019;s a curious courage to them both: they believe in a political reality which is utterly terrifying, and they&#x2019;re fighting it. Joe is never sure whether they&#x2019;re mad or just alarmingly and uncompromisingly incapable of self-delusion. <br><br> In any case, he gives any spare clockwork toys he has to the Watsons, and eats dinner with them once in a while to make sure they&#x2019;re still alive. They in their turn share with him vegetables from their allotment and keep an eye on the warehouse if he goes away for the weekend. The cat (Joe thinks of it as &#x2018;the Parasite&#x2019;) adopted them some months ago and now rules the houseboat by a combination of adept political and emotional pressure brought to bear through the delighted Watson children and a psychotic approach to the rodent population, which earns the approval of Mr. and Mrs. W. Sadly, the Parasite has identified the warehouse as its next home, if once it can destroy or evict the present owner, of whom it does not approve. <br><br> Joe peers into the piece of burnished brass he uses as a shaving mirror. He found it here when he took possession, a riveted panel from something bigger, and he likes the warmth of it. Glass mirrors are green, and make your image look sick and sad. He doesn&#x2019;t want to be the person he sees reflected in a glass mirror. Instead, here&#x2019;s this warm, genial bloke, a little unkempt, but&#x2014;if not wealthy&#x2014;at least healthy and fairly wise. <br><br> Joe is a big man, with wide shoulders and hips. His bones are heavy. He has a strong face, and his skull is proud beneath the skin. Passably handsome, perhaps, but not delicate. Unlike Papa Spork, who had his father&#x2019;s genes, and looked like a flamenco dancer, Joe is most unfairly designed by nature to resemble a guy who works the door at the rougher kind of bar. He gets it from his mother&#x2019;s side: Harriet Spork is a narrow creature, but that owes more to religion and meals high in fibre than it does to genetics. Her bones are the bones of a Cumbrian meat-packer and his Dorset yeoman wife. Nature intended in her design a hearty life of toil, open fires and plump old age attended by a brood of sun-touched brats. That she chose instead to be a singer and more latterly a nun is evidence of a certain submerged cussedness, or possibly a consequence of the strange upheavals of the twentieth century, which made rural motherhood look, at least for a while, like an admission of defeat. <br><br> From somewhere in the warehouse, there&#x2019;s a curiously suffused silence. A hunting silence: the Parasite, having declared war almost immediately upon making his acquaintance, enters each morning via the window that Joe props open to stop the place getting stuffy when the central heating comes on, and ascends to balance on the white, moulded frame around the kitchen door. When he passes underneath, it drops onto his shoulders, extends its claws, and slides down his back in an attempt to peel him like an apple. The leather jacket and, alas, the skin beneath&#x2014;because the first time this happened he was wearing only a pajama shirt&#x2014;carry the scars.<br><br>Today, tiring of a.m. guerilla war&#x2014;and sensitive to the possibility that while he is presently single, he may one day bring an actual woman to this place, and she may wish not to be scalped by an irate feline when she sashays off to make tea, perhaps with one of his shirts thrown around her shoulders and the hem brushing the tops of her elegant legs and revealing the narrowest sliver of buttock&#x2014;Joe has chosen to escalate the situation. Late last night, he applied a thin layer of Vaseline to the coping. He tries not to reflect on the nature of a life whose high point is an adversarial relationship with an entity possessing the same approximate reasoning and emotional alertness as a milk bottle. <br><br> Ah. That whisper is a silken tail brushing the mug tree with its friendly, mismatched china. That creak means the floorboard by the wall, that pitter-patter is the animal jumping from the dresser . . . and that remarkable, outraged sound must be the noise it makes bouncing off the far wall after sliding all along the coping, followed by . . . yes. An undignified thump as it hits the floor. Joe wanders into his kitchen. The Parasite stares at him from the corner, eyes spilling over with mutiny and hate. <br><br> &#x201c;Primate,&#x201d; Joe tells it, waggling his hands. &#x201c;Tool user. Opposable thumbs.&#x201d; <br><br> The Parasite glowers, and stalks out. <br><br> Having thus inaugurated Victory Over The Cat Day, it is in the nature of his world that Joe Spork should immediately be overtaken on the ladder of mammalian supremacy by a dog.</p><h2>Mississippi in Africa: The Saga of the Slaves of Prospect Hill Plantation and Their Legacy in Liberia</h2><p>Provides a close-up study of two hundred freed slaves from Mississippi who journeyed to Liberia to build a new colony, the cultural conflict that erupted between the colonists and native tribal peoples of the region, and the repercussions of that conflict in modern-day Liberia.</p><p>For most Americans, Liberia is a remote place in a distant continent with no connection to their daily lives. Few of us know that in the early 19th century, it was, in fact, an American colony, and to this day, contains communities called Mississippi, Louisiana, Georgia, Virginia, Kentucky, and Maryland founded by freed American slaves and populated by descendants of those slaves. Author Alan Huffman tells this story in his remarkable <i>Mississippi in Africa: The Saga of the Slaves of Prospect Hill Plantation and Their Legacy in Liberia Today</i>. The book begins as the author's attempt to flush out the details of a fascinating Mississippi family story about a prominent plantation owner's (Isaac Ross) desire to repatriate his slaves in Africa, but ends up being a complex and sensitive exploration of the legacy of slavery in the American South and Liberia. As Huffman traces Ross' descendants and those of his family's repatriated slaves, an intricate story of displacement, cultural identity, immigration, oppression, and racial politics unfolds. Ironically, when America's freed slaves immigrated to Africa, they brought with them the only social paradigm they knew, that of the Southern plantation. Overcoming severe hardship, they recreated that culture, and by the time Liberia became Africa's first independent republic in 1847, the minority American settlers had become the country's ruling class. Huffman adeptly shows how this legacy contributes to the current crisis in Liberia. <p> </p> <i>Mississippi in Africa</i> is at once historical and contemporary, personal and universal, local and global. As Huffman indicates, slavery "has existed throughout Africa's recorded history, and still has not entirely passed from the scene." Its pernicious consequences continue to affect the lives of millions caught in the devastating and endless civil war in Liberia, just as they continue to impact American life. Yet, Huffman repeatedly shows that this extraordinary story cannot be simply reduced to a polemical rendering of white oppression of blacks. It is so much more about the powerful versus the powerless. Thus, Huffman presents the subtleties that have shaped both the politics and human relations in this story with profound humanity and nuance. --<i>Silvana Tropea </i>The astonishing story of a planter&#39;s will, a slave revolt, and his freed slaves&#39; querulous and deadly legacy in war-torn Liberia</p><h2>The Wallflower 17: Yamatonadeshiko Shichihenge (Wallflower: Yamatonadeshiko Shichenge)</h2><p>UNEXPECTED ROOMIES<br><br>Just when Sunako and the four hottest guys in Japan had finally gotten used to living together, their landlady springs a shocking surprise: She&#x2019;s going to remodel the mansion and they&#x2019;ll be temporarily relocated to a luxury hotel.

Afterward, as his knights disperse in pursuit of individual glory, Arthur enviously wishes for a quest of his own.

Not only am I paid to do what I love most, but I get to do it without having to grow up. More accurately, the seven-year-old I Hudson is no longer relegated to an ever-receding file in the memory bank hut is once again out-front, fully engaged, sometimes even calling the shots in an active collaboration with Lis adult counterpart.</p><p>"I'll always be grateful for the solid, all-American upbringing I was given in the suburbs of Louisville, Kentucky, but going to school in Rome was a revelation for me. After graduating from Tyler School of Art in Rome, I extended my education by wandering through Europe, settling in Amsterdam for a few years, and then moving to Hong Kong, where I dabbled in the fashion industry. My travels eventually continued through Southeast Asia and culminated with four magical months in Bali. I finally reached New York, fulfilling a childhood ambition, in 1974. Although my original intent was to become a painter, the free-lance illustration work I picked tip to support myself soon predominated as my primary art form. Pursuing my vision in this direction eventually led to writing and illustrating children's books. I had always told stories with pictures. I began to paint with words.</p><p>"My series of picture books on the Arthurian legends represents the most ambitious and challenging opportunity that I've ever accepted. Called the central myth of Western civilization by philosopher Joseph Campbell, the Arthurian legends have been evolving over a 1,500 year period, along the way gathering tip and expressing our concepts of love, honor, and courage. Only within the last century have they taken the form of adventure novels for younger readers, and I know of no other attempt to compile the entire cycle into a series of picture books until now. The sheer scale of the material-the vast array of characters and the complexity of their relationships-is beyond Dickens or even "Days of Our Lives."</p><p>"The curious occurrence that I've experienced as I've delved deeper through the layers of allegory in my research is that as the underlying truth is revealed to me, I'm not only learning something new about the fine art of storytelling but usually something about myself as well. The first three books, for example, are about Arthur coming into his greatness. In the first book it is thrust upon him by accident of his birth, and in the second he achieves it through his own actions. Finally, in the third, he comes to realize the greatness inherent within himself, as it is within all of us. It is the kind of greatness that finds expression when we finally accept ourselves and embrace the roles open to us in lifewhether it is that of king, gardener, parent, or children's book author.</p><p>"My gratitude is boundless for all those who have Supported my creative progress and believed in me long before I believed in myself. By recognizing that writing and illustrating books for young readers is, in fact, my calling, I can serve a greater purpose than fulfilling my own needs. I am reminded of what I heard a blues singer once say: "Talent is God's gift to you. What you do with it is your gift to Him."</p></p><h2>Preserving: Conserving, Salting, Smoking, Pickling</h2><p><p><strong>Classic French preserving techniques updated for a modern audience.</strong></p><p>Preserve fruit, vegetables, meat and fish with a beautifully illustrated guide from France's favorite food author.

For the biographer this is a double-edged sword, however: there are many periods for which documentation is uncommonly difficult. Zdzislaw Najder&#39;s meticulously documented biography first appeared in English in 1983, garnering high praise as the best, most complete biography of Conrad. Najder&#39;s command of English, French, Polish, and Russian allowed him access to a greater variety of sources than any other biographer, and his Polish background and his own experience as an exile have afforded him a unique affinity for Conrad and his milieu. All this has come into play once again in the present, extensively revised edition: much of its extensive new material was unearthed in newly-opened former east-bloc archives. There is new material on Conrad&#39;s father&#39;s genealogy and his role in Polish politics; Conrad&#39;s service in the French and British merchant marines; his early English reading and correspondence; his experiences in the Congo; the circumstances of writing his memoirs, and much more. In addition, several aspects of Conrad&#39;s life and works are more thoroughly analyzed: his problems with the English language; his borrowings from French writers; his attitude toward socialism, his reaction to the reception of his books.</p><p>Zdzislaw Najder teaches at the European Academy, Cracow.Text: English, Polish (translation)</p><h2>Shapeshifter Tarot (Book Only)</h2><p><p>See Through the Eyes of a Hawk </p><p>Shapeshifting is about far more than simply taking on the image of another thing.

The expressiveness of the illustrations makes this one of the most powerful decks commercially available, well suited for use in spellcraft. Conway and Knight pool their considerable talents in the companion book, giving their lucid and vivid interpretations of the cards' literal and figurative meanings. The cards and book work together as a synergistic whole, a testament to the prowess of the authors and the illustrator. The <i>Shapeshifter Tarot</i> is analogous to the traditional tarot, save for the addition of three cards, "The Double," "The Journey," and "The Dreamer," which reflect the Celtic shamanic tradition on which this deck is based, a tradition that will teach you to access and direct animal energies to fulfill your own needs and at the same time bridge the chasm between humankind and nature. --<i>Brian Patterson</i><p>A native of the Pacific Northwest, author D.J.

It is the daily things, like what people eat and how they serve it.</p><p>� LAURIE COLWIN, Home Cooking �</p><p>WHEN WE EAT, we travel.</p><p>Think back to your last trip. Which are the memories that stand out? If you&#x2019;re anything like me, meals will be in the forefront of your mind when you reminisce about travels past. Tortilla, golden and oozing, on a lazy Sunday in Madrid; piping hot shakshuka for breakfast in Tel Aviv; oysters shucked and sucked from their shells on Whitstable shingle. My memories of the things I saw in each of those places have acquired a hazy, sepia quality with the passing of time. But those dishes I remember in Technicolor.</p><p>As Proust noted on eating a petit madeleine* with his tea, food escorts us back in time and shapes our memory. The distinct flavors, ingredients and cooking techniques that we experience in other spaces and times are also a gateway to the culture in question. What we ate in a certain place is as important, if not more so, than the other things we did there&#x2014;visits to galleries and museums, walks, tours&#x2014;because food quite literally gives us a taste of everyday life.</p><p>Whenever I go abroad my focus is on finding the food most typical of wherever I am, and the best examples of it. Food typifies everything that is different about another culture and gives the most authentic insight into how people live. Everyone has to eat, and food is a common language. </p><p>The late, great American novelist and home cook Laurie Colwin put everyday food alongside &#x201c;the great works of mankind&#x201d; in making a culture. I have to agree. A baguette, the beloved French bread stick, is the canvas for infinite combinations of quintessential Gallic flavors (from cheese to charcuterie and more). It is steeped in history* and can arguably tell you more about French culture than Monet&#x2019;s lilies. Moroccan food expert Paula Wolfert, a beatnik of the 1960s who flitted from Paris to Tangier with the likes of Paul Bowles and Jack Kerouac, also relates to Colwin&#x2019;s words. &#x201c;Food is a way of seeing people,&#x201d; she once said to me&#x2014;such a simple statement, but so true. Unlike guidebooks and bus tours, food provides a grassroots view of populations as they live and breathe. When we eat from the plate of another culture, we grow to understand&#x2014;mouthful by mouthful&#x2014;what it is about.</p><p>Eating from different cultures is not just a way of seeing people: it can train a different lens on the food itself, too. I started eating meat again a few years ago after twelve years of being a (fish-eating) vegetarian. But while I was happy to try all sorts of cuts and organs, lamb still troubled me. I&#x2019;ve loathed the fatty, cloying scent of roasting lamb since I was a child, an aversion that had become almost pathological. When I met Lebanese cook Anissa Helou for the first time, I casually slipped my antipathy for lamb into the conversation. Her jaw dropped. She told me this was impossible, that I couldn&#x2019;t write a book about the world&#x2019;s food without a taste for lamb. A few months later I was at her Shoreditch apartment eating raw lamb kibbeh (see page 170) and devouring it. Her delicately balanced homemade sabe&#x2019; bharat (seven spice mix) didn&#x2019;t so much mask as complement the strong flavor of raw meat, which we ate with white tabbouleh. I might not like British roast lamb, the smell of which wafted around my grandparents&#x2019; kitchen on many a Sunday, but it turns out I love raw lamb prepared in a Levantine kitchen. Persian ghormeh sabzi (lamb stew with herbs and kidney beans, see page 187) was also a revelation. Ingredients take on different guises in other cuisines, and this can transform our perception of them. </p><p>In recent years food has assumed a status analogous to film, literature and music in popular culture, expressing the tastes of society in the moment. Food manifests the zeitgeist. There are now global trends in food. In cosmopolitan cities from London to New York, Tokyo to Melbourne, crowds flock to no-reservations restaurants that serve sharing plates against a backdrop of distressed d�cor, or to street-food hawkers selling gourmet junk food and twee baked goods. Today&#x2019;s most famous food professionals&#x2014;from the multi-Michelin-starred Ren� Redzepi to neo-Middle Eastern pastry chef Yotam Ottolenghi and TV cook Nigella Lawson&#x2014;are another facet to celebrity culture. They prize creativity in the kitchen, drawing on many different culinary and cultural influences to make dishes that are unique to them, for which society&#x2019;s food lovers have a serious appetite. </p><p>Amidst this enthusiasm for food and the growing fascination with culinary trends (which seem to change as frequently as the biannual fashion calendar), there are gaps in our knowledge about &#x201c;pedigree&#x201d; cuisines. Self-proclaimed &#x201c;foodies&#x201d; may know who David Chang* is, proudly order offal dishes in restaurants or champion raw milk over pasteurized alternatives, but can they pinpoint what actually makes a national or regional cuisine? How do you define the food of, say, Lebanon or Iran? What distinguishes these cuisines from one another? What are the principle tastes, techniques of cooking and signature dishes from each? In short, what and why do people eat as they do in different parts of the world? </p><p>Taking you on a journey around forty world cuisines, my aim is to demystify their essential features and enable you to bring dishes from each of them to life. Remember: when we eat, we travel. Treat this book as your passport to visit any of these places and sample their delicacies&#x2014;all from your very own kitchen.</p><p>� WHAT IS A CUISINE? �</p><p>AMERICAN ACADEMIC-CUM-FARMER Wendell Berry once said that &#x201c;eating is an agricultural act,&#x201d; drawing attention to the fact that what we eat in a given place reflects the terrain and climate where local produce lives and grows. But this is an oversimplification, taking only geography into consideration.</p><p>In fact, a cuisine is the edible lovechild of both geography and history. Invasions, imperialism and immigration solder the influence of people&#x2019;s movement onto the landscape, creating cuisines that are unique to the place but, by definition, hybrid&#x2014;like that of Sicily, where the Greeks, Romans, Normans, Arabs, Spanish, French and, most recently, Italians have all had their moment of governance. Today, Sicilian dishes express both the peoples that have inhabited the island and the rich Mediterranean produce available there.</p><p>I have learned that no cuisine is &#x201c;pedigree&#x201d;; they are all mongrels, as hybrid as your average hound in the pound. Even those with the most distinctive national and regional character are the result of different human traditions being fused with physical geography and its produce.* Some cuisines are much younger than others&#x2014;those of the New World, for example&#x2014;but our knowledge of the more recent history in which they were formed proves a fascinating lesson in how a cuisine develops. </p><p>For example, we&#x2019;re going to travel to California (see page 297) not only because I have what might fairly be described as an overtly sentimental attachment to the place, but also because I believe that it has changed the way we look at food. Much of the food revolution that has taken place in recent years can be traced back to the Golden State and its distinctive approach to fusing its various inherited cooking traditions. They are the building blocks of something wholly new&#x2014;derivative yet authentic.</p><p>I like to think of cuisines as stews&#x2014;they often have the same or similar components as one another, but produce wildly different results. Consider how different Indian and Moroccan foods are, despite many fundamental similarities: clay-pot cooking, stewing and, most significantly, the specific spices they have in common: cumin, turmeric, cinnamon and infinite blends of these and others. As you&#x2019;ll see on the Spice Route map on pages 154&#x2013;55, the interplay between terrain and people&#x2014;geography and history&#x2014;gives each cuisine I explore in this book a unique chemistry and individual magic.</p><p>� HOW THIS BOOK WORKS �</p><p>ESTABLISHING AN EXHAUSTIVE DNA of forty world cuisines would be no mean feat. This book is intended to be an entry point only, a go-to guide for anyone with a fledgling curiosity about the building blocks that make up some of the world&#x2019;s key cuisines. It covers flavors and ingredients&#x2014;which spices are used, whether oil or butter (or no fat at all) is favored&#x2014;as well as how things are cooked and served. I&#x2019;ve highlighted key features of each cuisine in the Pantry Lists, your essential shopping list for each cuisine we visit on our journey. I&#x2019;ve also given you a few really typical recipes from each place. If you&#x2019;re keen to know more, turn to the Further Reading section on page 349 for suggested books on individual cuisines, by experts.</p><p>The Pantry Lists are not intended to be definitive catalogues, more an indication of the kinds of things you might want to have in stock (in addition to the Kitchen Essentials&#x2014;see page 7) when you cook from a particular tradition. They include ingredients that struck me as unique or localized to certain places&#x2014;such as Sichuan peppers from the Sichuan province of China, dried limes in Iran or piment�n in Spain&#x2014;and, I hope, will inspire you to read the chapter in question before embarking on your culinary voyage. Assume that, most of the time, the Pantry Lists won&#x2019;t include the ingredients I&#x2019;ve put on the Kitchen Essentials list unless I want to stress the prevalence of one in a certain place&#x2014;chickpeas in the Mediterranean, for example, or tahini paste in the Levant and Israel. No matter how important they are to a cuisine, the likes of extra virgin olive oil and garlic don&#x2019;t feature on Pantry Lists: they are staples to be found in every well-stocked kitchen, no matter which cuisine you are tackling.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve always taken a pretty relaxed approach to following recipes. They can be enormously useful in helping us to bring a dish to life, but too many of us are shackled by the idea that a recipe is a set of rules, which is a recipe for disaster. My advice would be to do what feels right. Put in more salt or avoid the fresh coriander if that&#x2019;s what appeals to your tastes, sear the steak or fry the omelette for a couple of minutes more or less if you&#x2019;re so inclined. No one knows your palate and cooking equipment like you do, so exercise some creative license.</p><p>Following the same logic, if you really want to make one of these recipes but can&#x2019;t find a certain ingredient or don&#x2019;t have a piece of equipment, don&#x2019;t let that put you off. Just try substituting the closest possible thing. Not everyone has access to a metropolitan array of ethnic shops selling niche ingredients or owns a tagine pot, and I firmly believe that you can embody authentic flavors without following a recipe to the letter. </p><p>You&#x2019;ll find a list of my Kitchen Essentials on page 7&#x2014;these are the equipment and ingredients I prefer never to be without in my own kitchen. A list like this will obviously differ from one person to another and you may find that mine doesn&#x2019;t reflect how you like to eat, but in my experience the things I have included enable me to whip up something tasty from a number of different culinary canons without too much difficulty. </p><p>Though in part a reference book, The World on a Plate is also deeply personal, showcasing my own culinary interests and experiences. It reflects where I&#x2019;ve been, the people I have spoken to, and what I like to eat. I&#x2019;ve chosen just forty of countless world cuisines so there are of course gaps, but I&#x2019;ve included those I consider particularly formative in our contemporary eating habits. (One particular revelation was the extent to which Persian cuisine&#x2014;the ancient cooking traditions of the country known today as Iran&#x2014;has influenced so many of the major cuisines we know and love: Indian, Turkish, Levantine, Mediterranean. You&#x2019;ll see that Persian influences keep cropping up over the course of this book.) For three European countries (France, Spain and Italy), China, India and the United States, I have included more than one region. They seemed to me too established and too regionally nuanced to justify grouping their various culinary enclaves together.</p><p>I want this book to be as comfortable by your bedside as it is by your stovetop&#x2014;as much a book to be read as to cook from. My job as a food journalist affords me the opportunity to meet some incredibly talented chefs, food experts and writers, from whom I&#x2019;ve taken inspiration and practical tips in equal measure. In each chapter, you&#x2019;ll encounter an authority about the cuisine in question. They are too numerous to name here, but all have been generous with their time, knowledge and cooking. (I have been well fed while writing this book.) </p><p>I hope you enjoy reading and cooking from The World on a Plate and that, with its help, you feel inspired to set off on some international journeys from your kitchen, reminisce about places already visited or enthuse about travels to come. </p><p>Bon voyage and bon app�tit!</p><p></p><p></p><p>KITCHEN ESSENTIALS</p><p>� EQUIPMENT �</p><p>WHEN I SAY &#x201c;essentials,&#x201d; I really mean it. I&#x2019;ve read plenty of cookbooks that assume you have a mandolin, a Kitchenaid, even a sous vide, all of which have their place&#x2014;but I wouldn&#x2019;t class any of them as essential. You won&#x2019;t need anything too specialist for most of the recipes featured in these pages. Remember, this is home-cooked food of the world and should require only the most rudimentary accoutrements of a working home kitchen.</p><p>I&#x2019;m of the opinion that too much cooking apparatus confuses things, and personally I avoid using anything that endangers my fingers with an electronic blade or leads to a lot of tedious washing up. That said, a blender, for example, is definitely a useful piece of equipment if you want to make dips, sauces, soups and so on, and therefore makes it onto my list.</p><p>My favorite list of essential kitchen equipment is &#x201c;The Low-Tech Person&#x2019;s Batterie de Cuisine&#x201d; in Laurie Colwin&#x2019;s Home Cooking. (If you like reading about food as much as you like cooking it, and if you like your food writing wry, dry and sometimes a little cutting, then you need to acquire this book.) I&#x2019;d echo most of Colwin&#x2019;s recommendations, although in many instances she suggests having two of things (spatulas, even soup pots), which aren&#x2019;t always entirely essential in my view, particularly if you have a partner/roommate/parent/other minion who is willing to wash up as you cook.</p><p>So here is a short list of what I consider to be necessary to make any of the recipes I&#x2019;ve featured in this book, and indeed for you to freestyle from any of the cuisines I have covered. The corkscrew and radio are obviously optional, but if you&#x2019;re anything like me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>LARGE NONSTICK FRYING PAN � It doesn&#x2019;t need to be expensive. I bought my favorite for less than twenty dollars in the supermarket.</p><p>SAUCEPANS � A heavy-bottomed Le Creuset-style one that can also go in the oven and a light, medium-sized one (again, of the affordable supermarket kind). It does help here to have two on hand.</p><p>WOK � An essential accessory in the student kitchen circa 1998, but still very useful for blasting stir-fry ingredients quickly and effectively so that they cook without losing their crunch and goodness.</p><p>DEEP BAKING DISH/RO...</p></p><h2>The Overworked American: The Unexpected Decline Of Leisure</h2><p>This pathbreaking book explains why, contrary to all expectations, Americans are working harder than ever. Juliet Schor presents the astonishing news that over the past twenty years our working hours have increased by the equivalent of one month per year a dramatic spurt that has hit everybody: men and women, professionals as well as low-paid workers. Why are we unlike every other industrialized Western nation repeatedly &#x201d;choosing&#x201d; money over time? And what can we do to get off the treadmill?</p><p><b>Juliet Schor</b> is associate professor of economics at Harvard UniversityAccording to my estimates, the average employed person is now on the job an additional 163 hours, or the equivalent of an extra month a year [up from 20 years ago]. Hours have been increasing throughout the twenty-year period for which we have data. The breakdown for men and women shows lengthening hours for both groups, but there is a "gender gap" in the size of the increase. Men are working nearly 98 more hours per year, or two and a half extra weeks. Women are doing about 305 additional hours, which translates to seven and a half weeks, or 38 added days of work each year. The research shows that hours have risen across a wide spectrum of Americans and in all income categories-low, middle and high. <p> Laundry provides the best example of how technology failed to reduce labor time. During the period from 1925 to 1965, automatic washers and dryers were introduced. The new machines did cut the time needed to wash and dry a load of clothes. Yet laundry time rose. The reason was that housewives were doing more loads-in part, because investment in household-level capital undermined commercial establishments. Laundry that had previously been sent out began to stay home. At the same time, standards of cleanliness went up.</p></p><h2>The Torch &amp; the Sword</h2><p><p>The Torch and the Sword continues the message that began in The Final Quest and continued in The Call. It is a call to live the greatest adventure for the most noble purpose. It is not for the faint of heart, but for those who desire to live as true knights of the cross, refusing to retreat before the great darkness of our time. It is for those who will stand with courage and resolution for truth, righteousness, and justice as messengers of the age to come. These are the ones whom Enoch prophesied would come with power in the last days and who are now awakening to their destiny.</p></p><p><p>Rick Joyner is the founder and executive director of MorningStar Ministries and Heritage International Ministries and is the senior pastor of MorningStar Fellowship Church.

Some were touts; others were true believers. On the sidelines, a Greek Chorus of seasoned professionals tried, vainly, to describe the emperor's new clothes.</p><p>Filled with colorful portraits of many of the central figures of the boom years -- Alan Greenspan, Henry Blodget, James Cramer, Abby Joseph Cohen -- <em>Bull!</em> draws together a complex cast of characters, illuminating the web of relationships that kept the market aloft.</p><p>More than a financial history, <em>Bull!</em> is a lively, often witty social history of the stock market that became a part of popular culture. It is also the tale of individual investors, which chronicles the intimate stories of ordinary people -- housewives and college professors, salesmen and waitresses -- who got caught up in the excitement and then watched their life savings drain away.</p><p>How did it happen that the very real risks of investing in stocks were forgotten? Mahar explodes the myth of "stocks for the long run," explaining how the market's promoters crunched the numbers to create the illusion that if an investor stays in the casino just a little longer, he is guaranteed to come out a winner. Casting Warren Buffett in a new light, she explains how a value investor is, in the end, a long-term market timer who understands that success depends on how much you pay when you get into the market -- and when you get out. By putting the bull market of 1982&#x2013;1999 in a larger historical context, she shows how, over time, longtime bull markets beget longtime bear markets.</p><p>The future defies prediction, but the history of financial markets makes one thing clear: markets always revert to a mean. Taken as a single story, <em>Bull!</em> is both an illuminating history and a cautionary tale about investing. Analyzing the economic and psychological forces that drive financial cycles, Mahar shows how an extraordinary influx of cash and credit, combined with the obsessive attention of a new financial media, created a cult of equities. Challenging the notion that stocks always outperform all other investments, she reveals why many of Wall Street's most experienced investors believe that the 21st-century investor needs to throw out the old rule book and make a new beginning as he plans for his financial future.</p><p>No investor should keep his or her money in the stock market without first reading this book.</p></p><p><p>Maggie Mahar is the author of <em>Bull! A History of the Boom and Bust, 1982&#x2013;2004</em>, a book Paul Krugman of the <em>New York Times</em> said "makes a devastating case against the contention that the market is almost perfectly efficient." In his 2003 annual report, Warren Buffett recommended <em>Bull!</em> to Berkshire Hathaway's investors. Before becoming a financial journalist in 1982, when she began to write for <em>Money</em> magazine, <em>Institutional Investor</em>, the <em>New York Times</em>, Bloomberg, and <em>Barron's</em>, Mahar was an English professor at Yale University. She lives in New York City.</p>Financial journalist Mahar offers a thorough and accessible history of the explosive 1982-1999 bull market that is illuminating as well as sobering from the current bear market perspective. She notes that most people swept up in the euphoria of this latest market surge failed to recall the lessons of 1929-1934 and 1970-1974, when earlier bubbles collapsed and investors lost heavily. Citing studies by esteemed economists John Kenneth Galbraith and Charles Kindleberger, Mahar reminds readers that this self-blinding euphoria is a regular feature of every bull market. In vivid detail, she documents the trends and outsized personalities that fueled this particular bull market, including the surge of leveraged buyouts of 1984-1987, the mania for junk bonds, falling short-term interest rates, the rush of individual investors into 401(k) retirement plans, the power (and appetites) of mutual funds and the media frenzy that lent an unlikely allure to quarterly corporate earnings reports. As the runup in stock prices gained momentum in the late 1990s while evidence of corporate accounting shenanigans mounted, Mahar's account assumes the compelling power of an oncoming train wreck. Survivors of the recent market meltdown can profit from Mahar's assertion: "Ultimately, secular bear markets teach investors to learn to manage risk in a different way, focusing not on the odds, but on the size of risk." Individual investors will also gather that they need to be more skeptical of some sources of "information" and to be much better informed not to be burned again.

With over nine million copies in print (the original text has been revised), this "little black book" offers daily thoughts, meditations, and prayers for living a clean and sober life. A spiritual resource with practical applications to fit our daily lives."For yesterday is but a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision" is part of the Sanskrit proverb quoted at the beginning of the book which has become one of the basic building blocks for a life of sobriety. In addition to a thought, meditation and prayer for each day of the year, this handy, pocket-sized volume also contains the Serenity Prayer and the Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions of Alcoholics Anonymous. It is a simple, yet effective way to help us relate the Twelve Steps to everyday life and helps us find the power not to take that first drink each day.</p><p>On the surface, the life that Mr. Reggie Smith is presently living seems quite unassuming. He is married for 25 years, the father or four children, three grandchildren and lives quietly in their tree-lined subdivision in Cobb County Georgia. That just goes to prove the point that Mr. Smith is making. The point that Reggie makes more loudly with his life, than he could ever say with words, is that there is a great deal going on in our families and communities that we are not talking about and people are dying needlessly from STIGMA, and the lack of information. You see, Mr. Smith is among the more than 1 million (registered) people in the United States living with HIV. There are many more that may be infected without knowing. There are many who know and because of fear of stigmatization don&#39;t say anything about it publicly. Yes, Reggie Smith, author of the much loved book &#34;Surrender To Heal&#34; - 7 Ways To Rise Above The Battlefield Of Life, is a long time survivor of HIV/AIDS. He asserts that there are many long-term survivors who have been having success using a holistic approach to healing and his life is certainly proof that it works! Hailing from the mean streets of the Southside of Jamaica, Queens (NY), the neighborhood that produced L.L.Cool J, Russell Simmons, and Kareem Abdul Jabbar, he survived the war that was waged against young black men in urban America, only to find himself, like many of his peers, a potential casualty to biological terrorism. The devastation of AIDS in our society, especially in the Black community, has created an ongoing post-traumatic stress reaction not unlike that of September 11th and the DC Sniper, except it is much more pervasive and cost our society much more in the way of financial and human capital. In the midst of this pandemic, it is incredible that there has been no public outcry loud enough to shift the priorities from war and destruction, to healthy dialogue concerning a greater shift in human policy.<b>Introduction</b><br><br><i>Twenty-Four Hours a Day</i> is intended for members of Alcoholics Anonymous as a help in their program of living one day at a time. It is designed for those who want to start each day with a few minutes of thought, meditation, and prayer.<br><br>These daily readings contain most of the material used in the booklet "For Drunks Only" and other AA literature; also some passages from "the Big Book," <i>Alcoholics Anonymous.</i><br><br>As a basis for the meditations in this book, the author has used many passages from the book, <i>God Calling</i> by Two Listeners, edited by A. J. Russell. Permission to use the universal spiritual thoughts expressed in this book, without using direct quotations, has been granted by Dodd, Mead &amp; Co., New York City.<br><br>The author hopes that these daily readings may help members of Alcoholics Anonymous to find the power they need to stay sober each twenty-four hours. If we don't take that first drink today, we'll never take it, because it's always today.<br><br><b>January 1<br>A.A. Thought for the Day</b><br>When I came into A.A., was I a desperate person? Did I have a soul-sickness? Was I so sick of myself and my way of living that I couldn't stand looking at myself in a mirror? Was I ready for A.A.? Was I ready to try anything that would help me to get sober and to get over my soul-sickness? Should I ever forget the condition I was in?<br><br><b>Meditation for the Day</b><br>In the new year, I will live one day at a time. I will make each day one of preparation for better things ahead. I will not dwell on the past or the future, only on the present. I will bury every fear of the future, all thoughts of unkindness and bitterness, all my dislikes, my resentments, my sense of failure, my disappointments in others and in myself, my gloom and my despondency. I will leave all these things buried and go forward, in this new year, into a new life.<br><br><b>Prayer for the Day</b><br>I pray that God will guide me one day at a time in the new year. I pray that for each day, God will supply the wisdom and the strength that I need.<br><br><b>January 2<br>A.A. Thought for the Day</b><br>What makes A.A. work? The first thing is to have a revulsion against myself and my way of living. Then I must admit I was helpless, that alcohol had me licked and I couldn't do anything about it. The next thing is to honestly want to quit the old life. Then I must surrender my life to a Higher Power, put my drinking problem in His hands and leave it there. After these things are done, I should attend meetings regularly for fellowship and sharing. I should also try to help other alcoholics. Am I doing these things?<br><br><b>Meditation for the Day</b><br>You are so made that you can only carry the weight of twenty-four hours, no more. If you weigh yourself down with the years behind and the days ahead, your back breaks. God has promised to help with the burdens of the day only. If you are foolish enough to gather again that burden of the past and carry it, then indeed you cannot expect God to help you bear it. So forget that which lies behind you and breathe in the blessing of each new day.<br><br><b>Prayer for the Day</b><br>I pray that I may realize that, for good or bad, past days have ended. I pray that I may face each new day, the coming twenty-four hours, with hope and courage.<br><br><b>January 3<br>A.A. Thought for the Day</b><br>When I came into A.A., I learned what an alcoholic was and then I applied this knowledge to myself to see if I was an alcoholic. When I was convinced that I was an alcoholic, I admitted it openly. Since then, have I been learning to live accordingly? Have I read the book Alcoholics Anonymous? Have I applied the knowledge gained to myself? Have I admitted openly that I am an alcoholic? Am I ready to admit it at any time when I can be of help?<br><br><b>Meditation for the Day</b><br>I will be renewed. I will be remade. In this, I need God's help. His spirit shall flow through me and, in flowing through me, it shall sweep away all the bitter past. I will take heart. The way will open for me. Each day will unfold something good, as long as I am trying to live the way I believe God wants me to live.<br><br><b>Prayer for the Day</b><br>I pray that I may be taught, just as a child would be taught. I pray that I may never question God's plans, but accept them gladly.<br></p><h2>Natural History: A Novel</h2><p>When a society tramp murders a soldier near the end of World War II, Connecticut detective Billy Bray investigates, not knowing that the case will have reverberations for the next two generations of his family</p><p>A compelling tour de force, Howard's ( Expensive Habits ) latest novel shows this immensely talented writer at her inventive best. Her glance keen and her hand sure, Howard depicts the Irish Catholic Bray family: county detective Billy Bray, his gentility-obsessed wife Nell, their son, reckless and charming James, and their daughter, pious and pudgy Catherine. Howard gives their lives solidity and depth against the background of her own hometown, Bridgeport, Conn., a city so accurately and specifically rendered that readers with a map could pinpoint every reference to streets, restaurants, stores, churches and movie theaters; social nuances are revealed with equal clarity. The fuguelike first section traces the movements of each of the Brays on one Saturday during WW II, when James breezes through a clarinet lesson, Cath is humiliated at a Girl Scout jamboree, Nell strives to achieve family harmony and Billy becomes involved in a sensational murder case in which a society woman shoots a soldier home on leave. Echoes of James Joyce become more resonant in the novel's middle section, where Howard switches to a cinematic, elliptical narrative device as James, now an actor of middling success, returns to Bridgeport to make a movie about that notorious murder, but spinster Cath intends to foil his plan by revealing a family secret. As counterpoint to this deliberately fragmented narrative, on alternate (facing) pages, is a long, loosely constructed series of vignettes that encapsulate Bridgeport's history and decline, along with tart comments about the novel's characters (who include a nun turned social worker, a vulgar movie producer and James's valiant wife, an ex-rodeo queen). The section reproduces newspaper clippings about the Park City's famous sons (P. T. Barnum, Walt Kelley, Robert Mitchum); quotations from the likes of Freud, Lewis Mumford and William James; literary allusions slipped in without pretension; and 30 photos and line drawings. It is a kind of intellectual doodling--idiosyncratic and whimsical. Howard tells readers that they have "no obligation" to read the insert; "when it is unamusing, just go on . . . with the story." Howard's vigorous prose--at once earthy and sophisticated--is a graceful, arresting mix of metaphor and demotic idiom, ironic humor and glistening images, all employed in astute observation of her cultural and intellectual world. If the cinematic format and the flip, clipped narration tend to hold the reader at an emotional remove, the work is made buoyant by the larky digression, yet effectively anchored by the traditionally narrated sections. In form and substance, this powerful novel places Howard squarely among the outstanding practitioners of late-20th-century fiction. 35,000 first printing; major ad promo; author tour. (Nov.) .<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.With analytic eye but forgiving heart, Howard relates the tortured history of the Brays, an Irish-American family living in Bridgeport, Connecticut, at the close of World War II. As adults, James and Catherine leave home but cannot come to terms with their lives, for they are trapped in the shadow of their bigger-than-life father. Howard wraps this story in a virtuoso display of literary fireworks: Conventional narrative alternates with filmic montage and actor's monolog, and a long section juxtaposes the storyline with facts and myths about Bridgeport notables, among them P.T. Barnum, Robert Mitchum, and Walt Kelly of Pogo fame. Unfortunately, these experimental parts do not always work, and they seem peripheral to the central action. Comparison with William Kennedy's Ironweed is inevitable but misleading. Whereas Kennedy's seemingly effortless experimentation works to unfold character and nudge along the story, Howard's virtuosity often intrudes; the seams show, detracting from the narrative strength of an otherwise fine novel.

A samurai who served under the Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu in the seventeenth century, he became a Zen monk at age 41 and evolved a highly original teaching style imbued with the warrior spirit. The warrior's life, Shosan believed, was particularly suited to Zen study because it demand vitality, courage, and "death energy," the readiness to confront death at any moment. Emphasizing dynamic activity over quiet contemplation, Shosan urged students to realize enlightenment in the midst of their daily tasks, whether tilling fields, selling wares, or confronting an enemy in the hear of battle.

We had all the other minorities in our little town&#x2014;why not the newest, the legally recognized undead? But rural northern Louisiana wasn&#x2019;t too tempting to vampires, apparently; on the other hand, New Orleans was a real center for them&#x2014;the whole Anne Rice thing, right?</p><p>It&#x2019;s not that long a drive from Bon Temps to New Orleans, and everyone who came into the bar said that if you threw a rock on a street corner you&#x2019;d hit one. Though you better not.</p><p>But I was waiting for my own vampire.</p><p>You can tell I don&#x2019;t get out much. And it&#x2019;s not because I&#x2019;m not pretty. I am. I&#x2019;m blond and blue-eyed and twenty-five, and my legs are strong and my bosom is substantial, and I have a waspy waistline. I look good in the warm-weather waitress outfit Sam picked for us: black shorts, white T, white socks, black Nikes.</p><p>But I have a disability. That&#x2019;s how I try to think of it.</p><p>The bar patrons just say I&#x2019;m crazy.</p><p>Either way, the result is that I almost never have a date. So little treats count a lot with me.</p><p>And he sat at one of my tables&#x2014;the vampire.</p><p>I knew immediately what he was. It amazed me when no one else turned around to stare. They couldn&#x2019;t tell! But to me, his skin had a little glow, and I just knew.</p><p>I could have danced with joy, and in fact I did do a little step right there by the bar. Sam Merlotte, my boss, looked up from the drink he was mixing and gave me a tiny smile. I grabbed my tray and pad and went over to the vampire&#x2019;s table. I hoped that my lipstick was still even and my ponytail was still neat. I&#x2019;m kind of tense, and I could feel my smile yanking the corners of my mouth up.</p><p>He seemed lost in thought, and I had a chance to give him a good once-over before he looked up. He was a little under six feet, I estimated. He had thick brown hair, combed straight back and brushing his collar, and his long sideburns seemed curiously old-fashioned. He was pale, of course; hey, he was dead, if you believed the old tales. The politically correct theory, the one the vamps themselves publicly backed, had it that this guy was the victim of a virus that left him apparently dead for a couple of days and thereafter allergic to sunlight, silver, and garlic. The details depended on which newspaper you read. They were all full of vampire stuff these days.</p><p>Anyway, his lips were lovely, sharply sculpted, and he had arched dark brows. His nose swooped down right out of that arch, like a prince&#x2019;s in a Byzantine mosaic. When he finally looked up, I saw his eyes were even darker than his hair, and the whites were incredibly white.</p><p>``What can I get you?&#x201d; I asked, happy almost beyond words.</p><p>He raised his eyebrows. ``Do you have the bottled synthetic blood?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>``No, I&#x2019;m so sorry! Sam&#x2019;s got some on order. Should be in next week.&#x201d;</p><p>``Then red wine, please,&#x201d; he said, and his voice was cool and clear, like a stream over smooth stones. I laughed out loud. It was too perfect.</p><p>``Don&#x2019;t mind, Sookie, mister, she&#x2019;s crazy,&#x201d; came a familiar voice from the booth against the wall. All my happiness deflated, though I could feel the smile still straining my lips. The vampire was staring at me, watching the life go out of my face.</p><p>``I&#x2019;ll get your wine right away,&#x201d; I said, and strode off, not even looking at Mack Rattray&#x2019;s smug face. He was there almost every night, he and his wife Denise. I called them the Rat Couple. They&#x2019;d done their best to make me miserable since they&#x2019;d moved into the rent trailer at Four Tracks Corner. I had hoped that they&#x2019;d blow out of Bon Temps as suddenly as they&#x2019;d blown in.</p><p>When they&#x2019;d first come into Merlotte&#x2019;s, I&#x2019;d very rudely listened in to their thoughts&#x2014;I know, pretty low-class of me. But I get bored like everyone else, and though I spend most of my time blocking out the thoughts of other people that try to pass through my brain, sometimes I just give in. So I knew some things about the Rattrays that maybe no one else did. For one thing, I knew they&#x2019;d been in jail, though I didn&#x2019;t know why. For another, I&#x2019;d read the nasty thoughts Mack Rattray had entertained about yours truly. And then I&#x2019;d heard in Denise&#x2019;s thoughts that she&#x2019;d abandoned a baby she&#x2019;d had two years before, a baby that wasn&#x2019;t Mack&#x2019;s.</p><p>And they didn&#x2019;t tip, either.</p><p>Sam poured a glass of the house red wine, looking over at the vampire&#x2019;s table as he put it on my tray.</p><p>When Sam looked back at me, I could tell he too knew our new customer was undead. Sam&#x2019;s eyes are Paul Newman blue, as opposed to my own hazy blue gray. Sam is blond, too, but his hair is wiry and his blond is almost a sort of hot red gold. He is always a little sunburned, and though he looks slight in his clothes, I have seen him unload trucks with his shirt off, and he has plenty of upper body strength. I never listen to Sam&#x2019;s thoughts. He&#x2019;s my boss. I&#x2019;ve had to quit jobs before because I found out things I didn&#x2019;t want to know about my boss.</p><p>But Sam didn&#x2019;t comment, he just gave me the wine. I checked the glass to make sure it was sparkly clean and made my way back to the vampire&#x2019;s table.</p><p>``Your wine, sir,&#x201d; I said ceremoniously and placed it carefully on the table exactly in front of him. He looked at me again, and I stared into his lovely eyes while I had the chance. ``Enjoy,&#x201d; I said proudly. Behind me, Mack Rattray yelled, ``Hey, Sookie! We need another pitcher of beer here!&#x201d; I sighed and turned to take the empty pitcher from the Rats&#x2019; table. Denise was in fine form tonight, I noticed, wearing a halter top and short shorts, her mess of brown hair floofing around her head in fashionable tangles. Denise wasn&#x2019;t truly pretty, but she was so flashy and confident that it took awhile to figure that out.</p><p>A little while later, to my dismay, I saw the Rattrays had moved over to the vampire&#x2019;s table. They were talking at him. I couldn&#x2019;t see that he was responding a lot, but he wasn&#x2019;t leaving either.</p><p>``Look at that!&#x201d; I said disgustedly to Arlene, my fellow waitress. Arlene is redheaded and freckled and ten years older than me, and she&#x2019;s been married four times. She has two kids, and from time to time, I think she considers me her third.</p><p>``New guy, huh?&#x201d; she said with small interest. Arlene is currently dating Rene Lenier, and though I can&#x2019;t see the attraction, she seems pretty satisfied. I think Rene was her second husband.</p><p>``Oh, he&#x2019;s a vampire,&#x201d; I said, just having to share my delight with someone.</p><p>``Really? Here? Well, just think,&#x201d; she said, smiling a little to show she appreciated my pleasure. ``He can&#x2019;t be too bright, though, honey, if he&#x2019;s with the Rats. On the other hand, Denise is giving him quite a show.&#x201d;</p><p>I figured it out after Arlene made it plain to me; she&#x2019;s much better at sizing up sexual situations than I am due to her experience and my lack.</p><p>The vampire was hungry. I&#x2019;d always heard that the synthetic blood the Japanese had developed kept vampires up to par as far as nutrition, but didn&#x2019;t really satisfy their hunger, which was why there were ``Unfortunate Incidents&#x201d; from time to time. (That was the vampire euphemism for the bloody slaying of a human.) And here was Denise Rattray, stroking her throat, turning her neck from side to side...what a bitch.</p><p>My brother, Jason, came into the bar, then, and sauntered over to give me a hug. He knows that women like a man who&#x2019;s good to his family and also kind to the disabled, so hugging me is a double whammy of recommendation. Not that Jason needs many more points than he has just by being himself. He&#x2019;s handsome. He can sure be mean, too, but most women seem quite willing to overlook that.</p><p>``Hey, sis, how&#x2019;s Gran?&#x201d;</p><p>``She&#x2019;s okay, about the same. Come by to see.&#x201d;</p><p>``I will. Who&#x2019;s loose tonight?&#x201d;</p><p>``Look for yourself.&#x201d; I noticed that when Jason began to glance around there was a flutter of female hands to hair, blouses, lips.</p><p>``Hey. I see DeeAnne. She free?&#x201d;</p><p>``She&#x2019;s here with a trucker from Hammond. He&#x2019;s in the bathroom. Watch it.&#x201d;</p><p>Jason grinned at me, and I marvelled that other women could not see the selfishness of that smile. Even Arlene tucked in her T-shirt when Jason came in, and after four husbands she should have known a little about evaluating men. The other waitress I worked with, Dawn, tossed her hair and straightened her back to make her boobs stand out. Jason gave her an amiable wave. She pretended to sneer. She&#x2019;s on the outs with Jason, but she still wants him to notice her.</p><p>I got really busy&#x2014;everyone came to Merlotte&#x2019;s on Saturday night for some portion of the evening&#x2014;so I lost track of my vampire for a while. When I next had a moment to check on him, he was talking to Denise. Mack was looking at him with an expression so avid that I became worried.</p><p>I went closer to the table, staring at Mack. Finally, I let down my guard and listened.</p><p>Mack and Denise had been in jail for vampire draining.</p><p>Deeply upset, I nevertheless automatically carried a pitcher of beer and some glasses to a raucous table of four. Since vampire blood was supposed to temporarily relieve symptoms of illness and increase sexual potency, kind of like prednisone and Viagra rolled into one, there was a huge black market for genuine, undiluted vampire blood. Where there&#x2019;s a market there are suppliers; in this case, I&#x2019;d just learned, the scummy Rat Couple. They&#x2019;d formerly trapped vampires and drained them, selling the little vials of blood for as much as $200 apiece. It had been the drug of choice for at least two years now. Some buyers went crazy after drinking pure vampire blood, but that didn&#x2019;t slow the market any.</p><p>The drained vampire didn&#x2019;t last long, as a rule. The drainers left the vampires staked or simply dumped them out in the open. When the sun came up, that was all she wrote. From time to time, you read about the tables being turned when the vampire managed to get free. Then you got your dead drainers.</p><p>Now my vampire was getting up and leaving with the Rats. Mack met my eyes, and I saw him looking distinctly startled at the expression on my face. He turned away, shrugging me off like everyone else.</p><p>That made me mad. Really mad.</p><p>What should I do? While I struggled with myself, they were out the door. Would the vampire believe me if I ran after them, told him? No one else did. Or if by chance they did, they hated and feared me for reading the thoughts concealed in people&#x2019;s brains. Arlene had begged me to read her fourth husband&#x2019;s mind when he&#x2019;d come in to pick her up one night because she was pretty certain he was thinking of leaving her and the kids, but I wouldn&#x2019;t because I wanted to keep the one friend I had. And even Arlene hadn&#x2019;t been able to ask me directly because that would be admitting I had this gift, this curse. People couldn&#x2019;t admit it. They had to think I was crazy. Which sometimes I almost was!</p><p>So I dithered, confused and frightened and angry, and then I knew I just had to act. I was goaded by the look Mack had given me&#x2014;as if I was negligible.</p><p>I slid down the bar to Jason, where he was sweeping DeeAnne off her feet. She didn&#x2019;t take much sweeping, popular opinion had it. The trucker from Hammond was glowering from her other side.</p><p>``Jason,&#x201d; I said urgently. He turned to give me a warning glare. ``Listen, is that chain still in the back of the pickup?&#x201d;</p><p>``Never leave home without it,&#x201d; he said lazily, his eyes scanning my face for signs of trouble. ``You going to fight, Sookie?&#x201d;</p><p>I smiled at him, so used to grinning that it was easy. ``I sure hope not,&#x201d; I said cheerfully.</p><p>``Hey, you need help?&#x201d; After all, he was my brother.</p><p>``No, thanks,&#x201d; I said, trying to sound reassuring. And I slipped over to Arlene. ``Listen, I got to leave a little early. My tables are pretty thin, can you cover for me?&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;d ever asked Arlene such a thing, though I&#x2019;d covered for her many times. She, too, offered me help. ``That&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; I said. ``I&#x2019;ll be back in if I can. If you clean my area, I&#x2019;ll do your trailer.&#x201d;</p><p>Arlene nodded her red mane enthusiastically.</p><p>I pointed to the employee door, to myself, and made my fingers walk, to tell Sam where I was going.</p><p>He nodded. He didn&#x2019;t look happy.</p><p>So out the back door I went, trying to make my feet quiet on the gravel. The employee parking lot is at the rear of the bar, through a door leading into the storeroom. The cook&#x2019;s car was there, and Arlene&#x2019;s, Dawn&#x2019;s, and mine. To my right, the east, Sam&#x2019;s pickup was sitting in front of his trailer.</p><p>I went out of the graveled employee parking area onto the blacktop that surfaced the much larger customer lot to the west of the bar. Woods surrounded the clearing in which Merlotte&#x2019;s stood, and the edges of the parking lot were mostly gravel. Sam kept it well lit, and the surrealistic glare of the high, parking lot lights made everything look strange.</p><p>I saw the Rat Couple&#x2019;s dented red sports car, so I knew they were close.</p><p>I found Jason&#x2019;s truck at last. It was black with custom aqua and pink swirls on the sides. He sure did love to be noticed. I pulled myself up by the tailgate and rummaged around in the bed for his chain, a thick length of links that he carried in case of a fight. I looped it and carried it pressed to my body so it wouldn&#x2019;t chink.</p><p>I thought a second. The only halfway private spot to which the Rattrays could have lured the vampire was the end of the parking lot where the trees actually overhung the cars. So I crept in that direction, trying to move fast and low.</p><p>I paused every few seconds and listened. Soon I heard a groan and the faint sounds of voices. I snaked between the cars, and I spotted them right where I&#x2019;d figured they&#x2019;d be. The vampire was down on the ground on his back, his face contorted in agony, and the gleam of chains crisscrossed his wrists and ran down to his ankles. Silver. There were two little vials of blood already on the ground beside Denise&#x2019;s feet, and as I watched, she fixed a new Vacutainer to the needle. The tourniquet above his elbow dug cruelly into his arm.</p><p>Their backs were to me, and the vampire hadn&#x2019;t seen me yet. I loosened the coiled chain so a good three feet of it swung free. Who to attack first? They were both small and vicious.</p><p>I remembered Mack&#x2019;s contemptuous dismissal and the fact that he never left me a tip. Mack first.</p><p>I&#x2019;d never actually been in a fight before. Somehow I was positively looking forward to it.</p><p>I leapt out from behind a pickup and swung the chain. It thwacked across Mack&#x2019;s back as he knelt beside his victim. He screamed and jumped up. After a glance, Denise set about getting the third Vacutainer plugged. Mack&#x2019;s hand dipped down to his boot and came up shining. I gulped. He had a knife in his hand.</p><p>``Uh-oh,&#x201d; I said, and grinned at him.</p><p>``You crazy bitch!&#x201d; he screamed. He sounded like he was looking forward to using the knife. I was too involved to keep my mental guard up, and I had a clear flash of what Mack wanted to do to me. It drove me really crazy. I went for him with every intention of hurting him as badly as I could. But he was ready for me and jumped forward with the knife while I was swinging the chain. He sliced...</p></p><h2>Don&#39;t Roll Your Eyes At Me, Young Man!

Each of these books is narrated by a strong woman growing up in the town and struggling with physical and emotional isolation.<br><br>In <i>The Stone Angel</i>, Hagar Shipley, age ninety, tells the story of her life, and in doing so tries to come to terms with how the very qualities which sustained her have deprived her of joy. Mingling past and present, she maintains pride in the face of senility, while recalling the life she led as a rebellious young bride, and later as a grieving mother. Laurence gives us in Hagar a woman who is funny, infuriating, and heartbreakingly poignant.<br><br>"This is a revelation, not impersonation. The effect of such skilled use of language is to lead the reader towards the self-recognition that Hagar misses."&#x2014;Robertson Davies, <i>New York Times</i><br><br>"It is [Laurence's] admirable achievement to strike, with an equally sure touch, the peculiar note and the universal; she gives us a portrait of a remarkable character and at the same time the picture of old age itself, with the pain, the weariness, the terror, the impotent angers and physical mishaps, the realization that others are waiting and wishing for an end."&#x2014;Honor Tracy, <i>The New Republic</i><br><br>"Miss Laurence is the best fiction writer in the Dominion and one of the best in the hemisphere."&#x2014;<i>Atlantic</i><br><br>"[Laurence] demonstrates in <i>The Stone Angel</i> that she has a true novelist's gift for catching a character in mid-passion and life at full flood. . . . As [Hagar Shipley] daydreams and chatters and lurches through the novel, she traces one of the most convincing&#x2014;and the most touching&#x2014;portraits of an unregenerate sinner declining into senility since Sara Monday went to her reward in Joyce Cary's <i>The Horse's Mouth</i>."&#x2014;<i>Time</i><br><br>"Laurence's triumph is in her evocation of Hagar at ninety. . . . We sympathize with her in her resistance to being moved to a nursing home, in her preposterous flight, in her impatience in the hospital. Battered, depleted, suffering, she rages with her last breath against the dying of the light. <i>The Stone Angel</i> is a fine novel, admirably written and sustained by unfailing insight."&#x2014;Granville Hicks, <i>Saturday Review</i><br><br>"<i>The Stone Angel</i> is a good book because Mrs. Laurence avoids sentimentality and condescension; Hagar Shipley is still passionately involved in the puzzle of her own nature. . . . Laurence's imaginative tact is strikingly at work, for surely this is what it feels like to be old."&#x2014;Paul Pickrel, <i>Harper's</i></p><p>With her life nearly behind her, the witty, irascible, and fiercely proud Hagar Shipley escapes from her nursing home and sets out in search of a way to reconcile herself to her tumultuous past. Through her reflections, we come to know the rebellious young bride in a remote prairie town, her love for her two sons, the freedom she claimed, and the joys she denied herself. In this bold, final step toward freedom and independence, Hagar gains a deeper understanding of the meaning of acceptance. Her thoughts evoke not only the rich pattern of her past experience but also the meaning of what it is to grow old and to come to terms with mortality.Margaret Laurence (1926-1987) is one of Canada&#39;s finest writers and is the author of five novels She was made a Companion of the Order of Canada in 1972 and she became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1977.</p><h2>God&#39;s Right Hand: How Jerry Falwell Made God a Republican and Baptized the American Right</h2><p>An acclaimed reporter presents the first major biography of the legendary, and divisive, conservative pastor who reshaped the landscape of American politics&#x2014;Jerry Falwell. At a time when the Tea Party movement is dominating much of America's social and political discourse, the story of Falwell's Moral Majority will resonate strongly. Indeed, Falwell&#x2019;s language may sound familiar to anyone who has heard recent speeches by figures like Sarah Palin, Rick Perry, or Michelle Bachmann.<br></p><p><p>Falwell did not eliminate the divide between religion and politics. Nor did he blur it. He jumped over it, bringing millions of voters with him, and he never looked back.<br>&#x2014;from the Introduction</p><p>Mounting concerns over the nation&#x2019;s moral decline. A populist critique of cultural elitism. Disdain for government involvement in private enterprise and health care. These themes dominate our political discourse, and have for a generation&#x2019;s worth of elections. And they are themes almost single-handedly brought to the fore by the Reverend Jerry Falwell. As America was questioning its most revered institutions in the wake of the Vietnam War and Jimmy Carter&#x2019;s malaise, Falwell was building his own institutional strength and influence, answering a felt need for certainty in a suddenly uncertain world. In this highly anticipated major biography, Michael Sean Winters traces the polarizing pastor&#x2019;s journey to reclaim America for Christ&#x2014;and his tireless work to define the orthodoxy and vocabulary that the Republican Party has used to great success ever since.</p><p>Falwell was, for many, the face of Christianity in America. The child of agnostic parents, he made a name for himself as a pastor and later founded his own Christian university. Initially ambivalent about politics, his controversial Moral Majority catapulted Falwell into the political arena. His life intersected with some of the most notable figures of his time, from Ronald Reagan, whom he helped elect president, to the scandal-ridden Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker. Falwell stared down pornographers and wrestled with women&#x2019;s groups. He battled with liberals and enforced a brand of orthodoxy on conservatives. He was a man of strong views&#x2014;and he knew that those views were shared by millions of Americans who were disengaged with public life. Falwell led them into the public square, articulated a coherent rationale for their involvement with politics, and made them the largest and most organized constituency in the contemporary Republican Party.</p><p>Today, no Republican candidate can hope to win elections without the support of evangelicals and fundamentalists, and the Tea Party has adopted nearly wholesale the rhetoric of Falwell&#x2019;s ministry. His legacy&#x2014;as controversial as it is consequential&#x2014;has never been more palpable. </p><p>Michael Sean Winters has written for publications including <em>The New Republic</em>, the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>The Washington Post</em>, <em>Washingtonian</em>, <em>Slate.com</em>, and <em>America</em>.

After the overwhelming horrors of the first half of the 20th century, described by Ian Kershaw in his previous book as having gone &#39;to Hell and back&#39;, the years from 1950 to 2017 brought peace and relative prosperity to most of Europe. Enormous economic improvements transformed the continent. The catastrophic era of the world wars receded into an ever more distant past, though its long shadow continued to shape mentalities. Europe was now a divided continent, living under the nuclear threat in a period intermittently fraught with anxiety. Europeans experienced a &#39;roller-coaster ride&#39;, both in the sense that they were flung through a series of events which threatened disaster, but also in that they were no longer in charge of their own destinies: for much of the period the USA and USSR effectively reduced Europeans to helpless figures whose fates were dictated to them by the Cold War. There were striking successes - the Soviet bloc melted away, dictatorships vanished and Germany was successfully reunited. But accelerating globalization brought new fragilities. The impact of interlocking crises after 2008 was the clearest warning to Europeans that there was no guarantee of peace and stability. In this remarkable book, Ian Kershaw has created a grand panorama of the world we live in and where it came from. Drawing on examples from all across the continent, Roller-Coaster will make us all rethink Europe and what it means to be European.</p><p>Sir Ian Kershaw is one of the UK&#39;s most distinguished historians. His most famous books include Hitler, Fateful Choices and The End. The first volume in his history of modern Europe, To Hell and Back, was described by the Observer as &#39;superb... likely to become and classic&#39; and by Harold Evans in the New York Times as &#39;chilling epic-size history... should be required reading&#39;. He lives in Manchester.</p><h2>Stories from the Growing Years (Grandma&#39;s Attic Series)</h2><p>The Grandma&#39;s Attic Novels bring you the story of Mabel O&#39;Dell&#39;s young adult years as she becomes a teacher, wife, and mother.

Praise for the first edition: &#34;This book strengthens Hick&#39;s position as one of the most significant thinkers of the second half of the twentieth century. . . . I highly recommend [it] to students of philosophy, history of religions, and comparative studies, as well as theology.&#34;-Chester Gillis, Journal of Religion &#34;The most persuasive philosophical advocacy for religious pluralism ever written.&#34;-Yandall Woodfin, Southwestern Journal of Theology &#34;[This work] evinces Hick&#39;s many virtues: ingenuity; fairness toward all arguments; deference to the standards of analytic philosophy; familiarity with Eastern as well as Western religions; and, not least, a clean, clear prose.&#34;-Robert A. Segal, Christian Century &#34;A leader in interfaith interpretation of religion, Hick has written what will probably become a classic. . . . Clear, readable, and comprehensive.&#34;-Library Journal &#34;Should be read by the adherents of all faiths.&#34;-Rabbi Dan Cohn-Sherbok</p><p>A leader in interfaith interpretation of religion, Hick has written what will probably become a classic in the philosophy of religion. Clear, readable, and comprehensive, the book is an expansion of his 1986-87 Gifford Lectures. After outlining his argument in an introduction stressing the nature of religion as a family-resemblance concept, Hick investigates religion from numerous perspectives: phenomenological, epistemological, pluralistic, and in terms of soteriological, ethical, and truth-claims criteria in order to conclude "that the great world traditions constitute different conceptions and perceptions of, and response to, the Real from within the different cultural ways of being human." Highly recommended for all academic and seminary libraries.<br><i>- Carolyn M.

By turns horrifying and erotic, Perry&#x2019;s new thriller takes us on a dangerous cat-and-mouse game that pits two women against each other: a beautiful serial killer and the detective who is determined to stop her.<br><br>When the cousin of Los Angeles underworld figure Hugo Poole is found shot to death in his Portland, Oregon, home, police find nothing at the scene of the crime except several long strands of blond hair hinting that a second victim may have been involved. Hotel security tapes from the victim&#x2019;s last vacation reveal an out-of-focus picture of a young blond woman entering and leaving his room. Could she also be a murder victim?<br><br>Portland homicide detective Catherine Hobbes is determined to solve the case and locate the missing blonde, but her feelings, and the investigation, are complicated when Hugo hires private detective Joe Pitt to perform a parallel investigation.

Perry lives in Southern California with his wife and two daughters.Chapter 1<br><br> Tanya stood in front of the full-length mirror on the bedroom wall and brushed her hair. She watched the other girl, in another room, wearing the same new blue skirt and tank top, using her left hand instead of her right to brush the long blond hair to a shine. Tanya had always secretly relished the existence of the other pretty girl who lived in the other room beyond the glass, like a fish in an aquarium. She loved the whole idea of a second girl who lived a second life.<br><br> In Wheatfield when she was little she had sometimes turned her mother&#x2019;s dresser so the mirror would be directly across from the full-length one on the closet door. She could make a whole long line of other girls, then kick her legs and look like the Rockettes, the nearest ones as big as she was, and the others smaller and smaller as their line stretched off into infinity.<br><br> She had dressed up in her mother&#x2019;s clothes sometimes, so she could change the girl in the mirror. She would be someone who had a good life, someone who was loved and cared for, someone who was beautiful and had everything she wanted.<br><br> She could invent things that the girl in the mirror could say, and practice them, whispering so the girl in the mirror would not be overheard. She would assume faces that were distant and just a little disapproving, and know that seeing them would make people frantic, trying to find ways to please her. She tried expressions designed to reward too, opening her eyes and mouth wide in a grateful smile that admitted no possibility of darker thoughts, nothing held back or hidden. Sometimes when she did that she would add a laugh at the end&#x2014;not a small, forced sound, but a delighted laugh that made her eyes glisten and her white teeth show to their best advantage.<br><br> The alarm system&#x2019;s cool male electronic voice announced, &#x201c;Kitchen . . . door&#x201d;: Dennis was finally home. This was it. Tanya stopped brushing her hair, slipped the brush into her purse, felt for the other handle and gripped it once, then released it.<br><br> She could hear Dennis&#x2019;s hard leather soles on the slate floor of the kitchen. There was no sound of his dropping his briefcase on the kitchen floor, so he had set it down gently: he had brought his laptop home again. He was planning to spend the evening working. &#x201c;Tanya?&#x201d; He was in the living room now.<br><br> She put her purse on the floor beside the dresser. &#x201c;Up here.&#x201d;<br><br> She spent the next fifteen seconds considering him&#x2014;turning him around and around in her mind and evaluating him. Women always said men had a hard outer shell but were soft and sweet and vulnerable inside, but she had found the opposite. They had a layer outside that was yielding and squeezable, but when you squeezed you began to feel the hardness beneath, like bone. She had squeezed him a lot in a short time, and she was already beginning to reach the hardness. He was getting ready to say no to her, to deny her things. Maybe he would even criticize her when the bills came and he could see everything added up. It was time.<br><br> Dennis&#x2019;s heavy shoes thumped on the carpeted stairway, coming closer. She already saw each step of the stairway in her mind, even though she had only been with Dennis Poole for a month, and all but a week of that had been spent in hotels. As he climbed step by step, she began to enumerate his unpleasant qualities. She didn&#x2019;t like his laugh. It was a quick staccato that made his voice go one octave higher, like a jackass&#x2019;s bray. A few times she had gotten up from her chaise next to him and gone into the hotel pool to cool her sun-warmed skin, come up from underwater, and seen him looking at other women in their bathing suits. He tipped waiters exactly fifteen percent and never a penny more, and was proud of it because it showed he could do the arithmetic in his head. He was not a sincerely appreciative lover. He pretended to care and be solicitous of her, but there was a practical quality about it. His concern was to please her, but it wasn&#x2019;t the right kind of concern. He wasn&#x2019;t a man unable to stop himself because he was enthralled. He was merely thinking about whether he was pleasing her enough to keep her.<br><br> Dennis had reached the top of the stairs. As she turned to look at him, her detachment was complete. He was a forty-two-year-old man with a soft belly and thinning hair who spent his days selling computer equipment to other men like himself. He was nothing. She smiled beautifully, stepped into his embrace, and kissed him slowly, languorously. &#x201c;Hello, cowboy,&#x201d; she whispered.<br><br> He laughed as she had expected. &#x201c;I could get used to coming home like this and finding you waiting for me.&#x201d; He looked more serious. &#x201c;You know, I&#x2019;m glad you were here for another reason. I think we need to talk about some things.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Sure. We can talk, but first, don&#x2019;t you want to get comfortable? I should think you&#x2019;d be tired after sitting in that office all day.&#x201d; She knew that tone of voice. Anyone could tell he was getting ready to be cheap with her, to start complaining about money. She pulled back and said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bet you&#x2019;re sick of wearing that suit. Why don&#x2019;t you get out of it, relax, and soak in the tub?&#x201d; She looked down at his tie as she loosened it, not into his eyes. &#x201c;Maybe I&#x2019;ll join you.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Good idea.&#x201d; He took his suit coat off and his tie, while Tanya went into the bathroom and turned on the water. The oversized Jacuzzi tub had jets that bubbled, so she turned them on too.<br><br> Dennis Poole was naked now, and he put his arms around her. She tolerated his embrace for a few seconds, then wriggled away and whispered seductively, &#x201c;Wait.&#x201d;<br><br> She went back out to the bedroom and walked to the dresser, where she had left her purse. She waited until she heard him turn off the water faucet, so the only sound was the steady burble of the jets. She quietly walked into the bathroom.<br><br> He was lying in the tub with his head cushioned by a folded towel, looking self-absorbed and distant as the bubbles massaged his skin. Tanya reached into her purse, took out the pistol, held it about a foot from his head, and squeezed. The report was a bright, sharp bang that echoed against the tile walls and made her ears ring. She turned away from the sight of his corpse, the red blood draining into the bath, and stopped being Tanya Starling.<br> 2<br><br> Hugo Poole&#x2019;s rubber-soled shoes made almost no sound as he walked along the sidewalk outside the CBS Studio Center&#x2019;s iron railings, past the soundstages on his way up Radford Street from Ventura Boulevard. He never would have set up a night meeting in the Valley, so far from the old downtown movie theater he used for an office, but he had often found that it was worth making small concessions just to learn what the other side wanted to do. There was no single precaution that would always work, and the least effective was never taking a risk. As soon as caution turned predictable, it became the biggest risk of all.<br><br> Still, he wished he could stay right here. He liked being near a television studio, because these complexes were usually on the itineraries of the people who heard voices telling them that God wanted them to punish a few actors. That ensured that there would always be plenty of jumpy security guards. He would have preferred to meet Steve Rao right here outside the gate, under the tall security lights.<br><br> Hugo Poole walked on beside the railing, now moving into the dimly lighted eucalyptus-lined blocks beside the big parking structure, and then he stopped at Valleyheart Street. He crossed the street to the city&#x2019;s chain-link fence and looked through it to the place where the concrete bed of the Tujunga Wash met the concrete bed of the Los Angeles River. On this hot midsummer night, the only water was the runoff from automatic lawn sprinklers, a steady trickle confined to a foot-deep groove a man could step across that ran down the center of each bed. In the rainy season this place became the confluence of two turbulent brown floods crashing together at thirty miles an hour and rushing south toward the Pacific.<br><br> Hugo Poole looked to his left, up the scenic walkway above the river toward the iron gate at Laurel Canyon that was designed to look like a big toad. At this hour nobody wanted to go for a walk above a concrete riverbed. He waited for the minute hand of his watch to reach the hour. Then he took out the key he had received in the mail. He unlocked the padlock on the gate above the wash, and slipped inside. Steve Rao&#x2019;s people had knocked off the city padlock and put on their own, then sent him the key to open it. Hugo Poole took a moment to close the gate. He reached into his pocket, took out his own lock, and placed it on the gate. He stuck Rao&#x2019;s key into Rao&#x2019;s lock, tossed them both down the hill into the bushes, and walked on.<br><br> He descended the sloping gravel driveway that the city had cut so its maintenance people could come down once a year to remove the tangle of dried brush and shopping carts from the concrete waterway before the rains. He reached the bottom, took a few steps onto the pavement of the river, and stopped to look around him. He could hear the distant whisper of cars flashing along the Ventura Freeway a few blocks away, and a constant dribble of water dripping out of a storm drain and running down the wall a few feet from him.<br><br> Hugo Poole&#x2019;s eyes adjusted to the darkness and picked out four silhouettes in the deeper shadow across the wash. They floated toward him, and Poole tried to pick out Steve Rao&#x2019;s s...</p><h2>Worth the Fighting For: A Memoir</h2><p>In 1999, John McCain wrote one of the most acclaimed and bestselling memoirs of the decade, Faith of My Fathers.

Regaining his health and flight-eligibility status, he resumed his military career, commanding carrier pilots and serving as the navy&#x2019;s liaison to what is sometimes ironically called the world&#x2019;s most exclusive club, the United States Senate. Accompanying Senators John Tower and Henry &#x201c;Scoop&#x201d; Jackson on international trips, McCain began his political education in the company of two masters, leaders whose standards he would strive to maintain upon his election to the U.S. Congress.

In 1986, McCain was elected to the U.S. Senate, inheriting the seat of another role model, Barry Goldwater.<br>During his time in public office, McCain has seen acts of principle and acts of craven self-interest. He describes both ex-tremes in these pages, with his characteristic straight talk and humor. He writes honestly of the lowest point in his career, the Keating Five savings and loan debacle, as well as his triumphant moments&#x2014;his return to Vietnam and his efforts to normalize relations between the U.S. and Vietnamese governments; his fight for campaign finance reform; and his galvanizing bid for the presidency in 2000.<br>Writes McCain: &#x201c;A rebel without a cause is just a punk.

A pending resolution to declare bourbon a distinctive product of the United States sat on their desks, and while most would pass it immediately, a few had reservations. The measure would convert this humble whiskey into an American classic on par with baseball or apple pie, and some legislators needed a little more justification from House staffers before granting this kind of lofty recognition. Of course, bourbon&#x2019;s modest pedigree wasn&#x2019;t their biggest concern: behind the measure lurked lobbyists for an industry with a shoddy reputation. During the previous decade, the Justice Department had investigated the predatory and monopolistic business tactics of the handful of companies, known as the &#x201c;Big Four,&#x201d; that controlled almost three-quarters of the liquor trade. There had also been a Senate investigation&#x2014;known as the Kefauver Committee&#x2014;that had revealed links between Big Four executives and organized crime chiefs dating back to Prohibition-era bootlegging. Surely, a resolution glorifying bourbon as an American original wasn&#x2019;t great use of political capital. Nevertheless, any misgivings between the lawmakers and lobbyists were eventually smoothed out&#x2014;no doubt in a way that involved drinking a lot of bourbon&#x2014;and the resolution was passed.</p><p>The next day, news of bourbon&#x2019;s coronation as an American icon made a scant media blip on the back pages of a few newspapers, and the resolution was soon forgotten.</p><p>A half century later, that legislation has risen above its inauspicious beginnings to become famous. Marketers and food writers love to burnish bourbon&#x2019;s credentials by reminding drinkers that even Congress, in all its awesome authority, has officially declared the spirit a unique part of America&#x2019;s heritage. For them, the resolution is a stamp of approval, verifying that the values implied by the frontier iconography found on countless bourbon bottles are inherently American: individualism, self-sufficiency, practicality, and guts. It means that these truths, which we Americans hold to be self-evident, are unquestionable and true. In 2014, after the National Archives loaned the original resolution to the Kentucky Distillers Association for display, the trade group&#x2019;s president even went so far as to tell a crowd of onlookers that the document was &#x201c;the Declaration of Independence for bourbon.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It&#x2019;s one of the most cherished pieces of our history.&#x201d;</p><p>But like all good American legends&#x2014;Paul Bunyan, Johnny Appleseed, the Headless Horseman&#x2014;the resolution&#x2019;s story has become embellished over time. In the years following its passage, people started dressing up its language, swapping the dry legalese of &#x201c;a distinctive product of the United States,&#x201d; which did little more than clarify bourbon&#x2019;s place of production, with the punchier &#x201c;America&#x2019;s Native Spirit.&#x201d; This zippier but inaccurate wording would help create a folksy sense of pageantry around bourbon, a little hokey but definitely better for marketing. Today, the catchier but misquoted language has become the norm. In 2007, when Kentucky senator Jim Bunning sponsored a bill to declare September &#x201c;National Bourbon Heritage Month,&#x201d; the legislation he introduced to Congress not only misquoted the original resolution, it added sentimental language connecting the spirit to a loftier set of ideals than the original resolution ever intended: &#x201c;family heritage, tradition, and deep-rooted legacy.&#x201d;</p><p>But regardless of how much bourbon truly deserves these accolades, it wasn&#x2019;t sentiment or patriotism that inspired the 1964 legislation. It was business, and a cutthroat one at that. The true driving force behind the resolution was actually a man named Lewis Rosenstiel, head of Schenley Distillers Corporation, part of the Big Four and one of the largest liquor companies in the world. The impetus for his move had happened more than a decade earlier, when Rosenstiel mistakenly evaluated that the Korean War would create whiskey shortages like those suffered during World War II. In preparation, he ordered his distilleries to produce at full blast, helping push total stocks of American whiskey held in storage past 637 million gallons, enough to supply national demand for nearly eight years. When the war quickly ended without the shortages Rosenstiel had anticipated, his surplus gave him control of roughly two-thirds of the nation&#x2019;s aged whiskey stocks, according to his competitors. This was a disaster from a business perspective&#x2014;Americans were drinking plenty of whiskey, but demand was dwarfed by supply. Since bourbon evaporates at a rate somewhere between 3 and 7 percent a year while it ages in wooden barrels, much of Rosenstiel&#x2019;s investment threatened to vanish into thin air before he could sell it.</p><p>Rosenstiel had spent tens of millions of dollars on creative ad campaigns and lobbied Congress for changes to industry regulations that would make it easier for him to sell his whiskey. Even though most of his lobbying initiatives were good for the industry as a whole, such as tax breaks, some had met fierce resistance from Rosenstiel&#x2019;s Big Four counterparts. Whenever these other executives assessed that a looming rule change might give Schenley an unfair advantage&#x2014;even though it might be good for the whiskey trade in general&#x2014;they&#x2019;d undermine it within the Distilled Spirits Institute, the industry&#x2019;s main lobbying group.</p><p>During one such impasse in 1958, over a change in tax codes, Rosenstiel responded by forming his own renegade lobbying organization, which he called the Bourbon Institute. Running the organization for him was retired navy vice admiral William Marshall, a man who had commanded a destroyer at Omaha Beach during the Normandy invasion. Marshall folded the resolution into the lobbying group&#x2019;s broader strategy of giving bourbon international trade protection so Rosenstiel could expand into overseas markets. In being declared &#x201c;a distinctive product of the United States,&#x201d; bourbon would be afforded the same regional trade designations as scotch whisky, French cognac, and champagne, giving U.S. producers like Rosenstiel a competitive advantage abroad. It would also prevent U.S. merchants from importing products called bourbon from overseas, protecting the domestic market from unwanted outsiders (one of the resolution&#x2019;s few congressional opponents was indeed a New York politician representing two Manhattan heiresses earning royalties from imports of a cheap &#x201c;bourbon&#x201d; made at a distillery in Ju�rez, Mexico).</p><p>Before the 1964 resolution passed, Rosenstiel put in place the rest of his overseas sales strategy. He sent a case of bourbon to every U.S. embassy in the world and spent $35 million on a global marketing campaign. It was all a gamble&#x2014;bourbon had little name recognition in foreign markets&#x2014;but Rosenstiel was a solid bet to reverse that trend. By this point, he had been involved in the liquor trade for nearly a half century and hadn&#x2019;t encountered much failure. He was a tough operator who had made his bones in the industry during the lawless years of Prohibition, the same decade when U.S. president Calvin Coolidge declared, &#x201c;The chief business of the American people is business.&#x201d; That quote would eventually become famous and no doubt was still ringing in Rosenstiel&#x2019;s ears when Congress passed the 1964 resolution. Of course, by that point this corporate titan was already one of the richest men in America.</p><p>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;</p><p>Like no other American product, bourbon embodies capitalism&#x2014;a word that&#x2019;s dirty to some, beautiful to others, but has nonetheless shaped our political and cultural life as much as it determines how we do business. Early styles of American whiskey, bourbon among them, allowed farmers to preserve the value of surplus grain crops by converting them into spirits. This liquid soon became the frontier&#x2019;s de facto currency, knitting together America&#x2019;s early economy. Then, when the question of taxing these spirits erupted during the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794, the ideologies of Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson clashed in a battle to define the soul of American business. While the debate roared, the trappings of a cottage industry gave way to factories and, according to business lore, the term &#x201c;brand name&#x201d; entered the American lexicon as distillers began differentiating themselves from one another by branding their names onto the ends of whiskey barrels. The evolution wouldn&#x2019;t be complete, however, until bourbon, that spirit born on the frontier, would come of age on Madison Avenue. The style of modern marketing it helped create would define the system of commerce that America would eventually spread across the globe.</p><p>But just as bourbon helped shape U.S. history, it was also shaped by it. The spirit&#x2019;s recipe was determined by the migration of Americans drifting west to places where corn, its main ingredient, was more prevalent than the grains primarily used in other whiskey styles such as rye. Most of bourbon&#x2019;s flavor also comes from aging in wooden barrels, which was an outgrowth of America&#x2019;s shifting trade patterns: as the empire expanded, people noticed that whiskey shipped in barrels on relatively longer voyages tasted better after absorbing flavors from the wood. America&#x2019;s Industrial Revolution brought scientific advances that would change bourbon, just as other technological innovations today keep doing. Finally, there&#x2019;s government lobbying. This strange art&#x2014;which helps guide the &#x201c;invisible hand&#x201d; that economist Adam Smith credited with building the wealth of nations&#x2014;always has, and always will, affect whiskey by influencing production standards, regulations, and profits.</p><p>None of this history, however, is brought up in the dry language of the 1964 resolution. The declaration doesn&#x2019;t explain how bourbon is the tale of a nation told on a condensed scale: the humble origins, ambition and promise, innovation driven by necessity, the dizzying wealth, corruption, downfall, and redemption. Nor did the legislation mention that textbook history and the carefully cultivated myths of the whiskey industry are often overshadowed by stories as shocking as they are impressive: the nation as it really works, built by men like Lewis Rosenstiel as well as the frontier icons you find on many bourbon bottles. We hold up bourbon as a mirror of the America psyche, but the images it reflects&#x2014;seen on whiskey labels that portray our evolving attitudes toward race, class, sex, and religion&#x2014;always confound expectations.</p><p>Other drinks have concrete images&#x2014;beer is for the everyman even when it&#x2019;s expensive and hyper-crafty, while wine is typically considered sophisticated and swanky even when you buy it at a gas station. Bourbon, though, is a shapeshifter. It can be a refined drink or it can be rough, depending on how it&#x2019;s served and who&#x2019;s drinking it. Sometimes it conjures up images of old men sitting around in deep leather chairs, power brokers who spend their time in rooms decorated with oil paintings of other old men with good posture and impressive facial hair. At other times it makes you think of cowboys getting arrested&#x2014;one fun but probably untrue bit of drinking lore even claims that the expression &#x201c;a shot of whiskey&#x201d; originated from how much whiskey cowboys got for trading a round of ammunition at the saloon.</p><p>Of course, these old stereotypes are fast changing. Today, women have cracked into the old boys&#x2019; club and are just as likely to drink whiskey as men, while the rowdy cowboys are replaced by whiskey geeks who sniff cautiously at the edges of their glasses before dutifully noting aromas of &#x201c;hibiscus,&#x201d; &#x201c;buttery oak,&#x201d; or &#x201c;stewed fruits&#x201d; in their tasting notebooks.</p><p>Speaking of tasting notes, voluminous pages of these can be found in many other fine books that scrutinize and rank individual brands. These sources are a helpful first step for understanding whiskey, but I ultimately believe that examining the spirit&#x2019;s history is the best guide. Rankings are subjective, arbitrary, and vulnerable to the industry&#x2019;s marketing efforts. Certain qualities&#x2014;the length of time a whiskey is aged in a barrel, proof, the grains used in different recipes&#x2014;have come to be more appreciated than others. And why is that exactly? The answer is for reasons aside from what actually gives us the most pleasure. We taste with our minds as much as our senses, and perceptions of status and image&#x2014;the products of economics, politics, and culture&#x2014;dictate many of our &#x201c;rules&#x201d; about connoisseurship.</p><p>For instance, when Lewis Rosenstiel was lobbying for the 1964 resolution, he was also investing $21 million ($167 million today) on ad campaigns to reeducate the palates of drinkers toward particular whiskey styles of which he held vast surpluses. Some of it was good, but some of it wasn&#x2019;t&#x2014;it didn&#x2019;t matter, he simply needed to get rid of the stuff. Nevertheless, you can still see the fallout from those ad campaigns today when celebrity chefs or the other various apparatchiks of the foodie-industrial complex offer questionable advice about what to buy or what is the &#x201c;best.&#x201d; Much of this talk is just white noise, doing little to demystify the array of bottles on store shelves today. Knowing the history, though, and how some of these &#x201c;rules&#x201d; came to be, clears the marketing fog and helps us make our choices more objectively. Fortunately, the lessons are usually refreshing, revealing the best bottles to be hidden gems, and not always the ones that are the most expensive or discussed.</p><p>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;</p><p>Even though the true origins of the 1964 resolution aren&#x2019;t particularly romantic, the document&#x2019;s sentimentalized meaning has become today&#x2019;s reality. This has helped drive bourbon&#x2019;s resurgent popularity this century, a comeback that is often credited to the drink&#x2019;s &#x201c;authenticity,&#x201d; a term used to describe unbroken heritage and trueness. We often imagine that bourbon connects us to a past that was somehow less complicated, and we&#x2019;ve turned to it for relief from modern confusion. Bourbon&#x2019;s sales this century have spiked to their highest level since Rosenstiel&#x2019;s 1964 resolution, and I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s coincidence that the uptick has come during times of confusing change. The economy is booming, but the new industries are tearing asunder the old ones and leaving inequality in their wake. Our political leaders are smart products of the meritocracy, but Washington seems more angry and gridlocked than ever. And while technology today better connects us, it has also managed to disconnect us, replacing actual conversation with the numb glow of tiny screens. Some pundits speculate that these changes spell the decline of the American Empire, but I have no idea if this is true or not. What I do know is that we could all probably use a drink of bourbon right now.</p><p>In this way, bourbon is comfort food. As the world becomes more complex, bourbon remains simple&#x2014;its foundation is little more than a balanced combination of grains, mostly composed of corn, that is fermented and distilled into alcohol. It also remains gloriously inefficient as the ruthless efficiency of new industries unsettles the modern economy&#x2014;the better part of a decade is required to make it well, as it sits quietly in charred oak barrels absorbing flavor from the wood and waiting patiently to be ready. And as the workplace ...</p></p><h2>Money, Greed, and God: Why Capitalism Is the Solution and Not the Problem</h2><p>Christianity generally sees capitalism as either bad because it causes much of the world&#39;s suffering, or good because God wants you to prosper and be rich. But there is a large, growing audience of evangelical and mainline Christians who are deeply uneasy about how to follow Jesus&#39;s mandate to care for the poor and the environment while living with the excesses of capitalism. Now, a noted Christian scholar argues that there is a middle view that reveals Christianity cannot only accommodate capitalism, but Christian theology can help explain why capitalism works.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s he seemed to be on the spot, ready to advise presidents and offer his wisdom on the issues of the day. Yet Clifford's impact on American politics began much earlier, with the presidency of Harry Truman who named him Special Counsel. Clifford retained this title under John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson and was a key figure in many of the pivotal policy decisions of the Sixties (especially the Cuban Missile Crisis and Vietnam escalation). This memoir is both a political history of the postwar years, as well as an intimate inside look at the workings of power. Clifford's portraits of major political figures are fresh and illuminating, and the book is filled with useful anecdotes both from his public and private life. He concludes with some ruminations on the Reagan-Bush years and broader reflections on history and politics. An essential book for most libraries. Previewed in Prepub Alert, LJ 2/1/91.<br><i>- Thomas A. Karel, Franklin &amp; Marshall Coll. Lib., Lancaster, Pa.</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.Presidential adviser Clifford had a hand in the launching of the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, the birth of the present national security system and other seminal events in the post-WW II era. He served as President Kennedy's personal lawyer, was Lyndon Johnson's closest adviser during the Vietnam war and succeeded Robert McNamara as secretary of Defense. Though he has much of interest to say about the presidencies of Johnson and Carter in particular, Clifford's re-creation of the Truman years (about a fourth of the book) is most memorable and deeply felt. His admiration for Harry Truman as a chief executive and as a man is profound. Written with former assistant secretary of State Holbrooke, Clifford's memoir is a treasure of historical information, vivid anecdotes and sharp insights into Washington politics and policy over the past four and a half decades.

There's hardly any mystery involved; the mining company is identified as the villain early on, and Du Pre's efforts to pin responsibility on Persephone take second place to the detailed exposition of Native American customs, rituals, and dialect; the expertly evoked ambiance of the harsh Montana environment; and the well-drawn minor characters, particularly Bart, Madeline, and Billy Gourard, a young Native American boy whose final futile effort to make the mining company accept responsibility for its crime provides the denouement.

Then, natural resources were abundant and labor was the limiting factor of production. But now, there&#39;s a surplus of people, while natural capital natural resources and the ecological systems that provide vital life-support services is scarce and relatively expensive. In this groundbreaking blueprint for a new economy, three leading business visionaries explain how the world is on the verge of a new industrial revolution. Natural Capitalism describes a future in which business and environmental interests increasingly overlap, and in which companies can improve their bottom lines, help solve environmental problems and feel better about what they do all at the same time. Citing hundreds of compelling stories from a wide array of sectors, the book shows how to realize benefits both for today&#39;s shareholders and for future generations and how, by firing the unproductive tons, gallons, and kilowatt-hours, it&#39;s possible to keep the people who will foster the innovation that drives future improvement.</p><p>In <i>Natural Capitalism,</i> three top strategists show how leading-edge companies are practicing "a new type of industrialism" that is more efficient and profitable while saving the environment and creating jobs. Paul Hawken and Amory and Hunter Lovins write that in the next century, cars will get 200 miles per gallon without compromising safety and power, manufacturers will relentlessly recycle their products, and the world's standard of living will jump without further damaging natural resources. "Is this the vision of a utopia? In fact, the changes described here could come about in the decades to come as the result of economic and technological trends already in place," the authors write.<p> They call their approach natural capitalism because it's based on the principle that business can be good for the environment. For instance, Interface of Atlanta doubled revenues and employment and tripled profits by creating an environmentally friendly system of recycling floor coverings for businesses. The authors also describe how the next generation of cars is closer than we might think. Manufacturers are already perfecting vehicles that are ultralight, aerodynamic, and fueled by hybrid gas-electric systems. If natural capitalism continues to blossom, so much money and resources will be saved that societies will be able to focus on issues such as housing, contend Hawken, author of a book and PBS series called <i>Growing a Business</i>, and the Lovinses, who cofounded and directed the Rocky Mountain Institute, an environmental think tank. The book is a fascinating and provocative read for public-policy makers, as well as environmentalists and capitalists alike. <i>--Dan Ring</i></p>A critique of the present economic system and its destructive effects on natural assets, coupled with ideas about how to make it work better. The Lovinses, directors of the Rocky Mountain Institute, a resource policy center, and business author Hawken (The Ecology of Commerce, 1993, etc.) merge their talents and experiences here to offer practical guidelines for reducing the environmental messes made by the industrial world, including pollution, transportation congestion, erosion, and wasted energy of all types. While suggesting solutions, however, they use a good deal of space to attack both contemporary enterprises and those dating to the Industrial Revolution. Targets include specific technologies, corporations, and general business practices, as well as wasteful consumer habits. The aluminum can, for example, is examined in particular detail, from ore mines to assembly lines. Capitalism as an economic system is criticized as a financially profitable, nonsustainable aberration in human development.'' Also attracting debate is the free market, vilified as one of the forces causing waste and pollution. This seems unfair, since the same system is an underlying aspect of the solutions cited throughout the book. Rather than abandon capitalism altogether, the authors argue for modification, yielding what they call ``natural capitalism.'' This could mean, for example, assigning value to electricity that is unused, what they call ``negawatts.'' They offer detailed explanations of ideas that yield positive resultsi.e., reduced energy usage in a mechanical appliancebut fail to provide a step-by-step plan of action for broader applications. The book nonetheless yields unique value as a broad collection of intriguing ideas that work and compelling pleas for the benefit they bring: increased profits. Despite their unease with the present economic system, the authors ultimately favor individual responsibility and local and entrepreneurial initiatives for solving environmental problems. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

On the table lay a tragic sight. The silver-coloured she-cat was still bleeding, her flanks heaving with the desperate effort to stay alive. Next to her lay the barely living bodies of her two kittens. With immense difficulty I had rescued them and rushed them here for help. 'There'll be nothing I can be doing for any of them. They're all goners!' he said, with professional finality. His Scottish brogue was oddly comforting in that sterile, clinical atmosphere. His examination had been short but thorough. I could see expressed in the eyes of Mac the Vet the professional conclusion that saving these cats was beyond the scope and skills of modern veterinary science. 'They're past hope, laddie,' he intoned gently, perhaps fearful of my reaction. I winced at his words, not wanting to believe him as I gazed once more at the threesome lying before me on the table. Mac was right, of course, his expertise was beyond question. From appearances nothing humanely could bedone for these creatures other than a swift and painless death but I had stubbornly clung on to the hope that somehow they could be saved. In my optimism I had imagined that Mac could work a miracle and restore them to health. Then I would take the whole family home with me. I lived alone and, although I had a demanding professional life, I had long toyed with the idea of having a pet, but had never got around to acquiring one. As I looked at them again, the small hope I'd nursed started to die. They did appear to be beyond help. The she-cat was obviously too far gone to save. I imagined that her scrawny body had once been beautiful, with its silver-grey fur and elegant tail, but she was drifting helplessly in and out of consciousness as she struggled to survive. 'She'll have to be put down,' Mac said in his no-nonsense manner. 'And it would be a mercy for the kittens to go as well,' he concluded. 'They're far too young to fend for themselves even if they survive.' He left the room with the mother, intent on doing what had to be done. While he was away, I looked down at the two kittens. Both of them were male, 'Tommies' as Mac called them. One was coloured smoky blue-grey and the other was black, with minute white markings. Neither was any bigger than a shrew. Sorrowfully, I reached down to touch them, simply as a gesture of compassion. There was no warmth nor any other sign of life in the grey kitten's bodybut when my fingers stroked the black-and-white kitten he stirred ever so slightly and I thought I heard a faint sigh. Suddenly, the kitten moved, curling its tiny body as if to cuddle up to the warmth of my hand. Startled, I looked down again at this little waif. It had certainly moved but I didn't know whether this was because it was in the throes of death or not. I found myself becoming very angry. 'Cats are very special creatures. It's grossly unfair that things like this should be allowed to happen,' I said to myself, overcome by the strength of my feelings. I recalled long-forgotten incidents and experiences that years spent as a city-dweller had all but obliterated. The simple reaction of the kitten to the warmth of my hand revived a memory of myself as a small boy who naively believed that his love for animals, birds, flowers and trees would somehow serve to protect them. I'd thought that by cherishing 'Nature' in all its forms I could conserve it. I had not thought about such things for many years but, lately, these childhood feelings had started to resurface, inspired no doubt by my rural surroundings. Images from the past flooded my mind as, with my finger and thumb, I gently stroked the body of the black kitten and waited for the vet to return. Best remembered were the days of my childhood spent in the woods and fields by the River Derwent and at the lake at Axwell ParkEstate where I was born. Out of nowhere came the memory of the hurt I felt when I fell out with my best friend, Billy Morrison, as we explored Winlaton Woods because he wanted to take some eggs from a blue-tit's nest we'd found in a hollowed oak tree and I wouldn't let him. I also recalled the shock one Sunday morning of finding a mallard duck flapping about in the meadow grass with half her wing shot away by the irresponsible hunters out for a morning's 'sport'. Like the poet Wordsworth, I had always loved nature and now, at twenty-nine years of age, living a bachelor existence and working in a country market town, these feelings were crystallizing into what was becoming a devotion to the wild creatures and landscapes of Northumberland. It was 1966 and I had been given the opportunity to work as a lecturer in Educational Studies at Alnwick College of Education in Northumberland. Consequently, I had bought Owl Cottage, an eighteenth-century stone building which stood on a hillside above the River Coquet, with uninterrupted views across the village of Felton towards the distant Cheviot Hills. This was to be a new beginning, the fulfilment of a dream. In the past cats had always been a part of my life and the households of my childhood and youth were never without at least one cat. I loved them all, not least for their dignified and independent natures. Every one of them had been a friend and playmate and every one of themwas special. Cats have always fascinated me because they are so mysterious and difficult to analyse in spite of their domesticity. I knew that cats probably first became domesticated in Ancient Egypt, about 15,000 years ago. For a time cats were even adored as representatives of gods, and their images were sculpted in precious metals encrusted with jewels. Once, on a working trip to Trinity College, Dublin, I was intrigued to find an illustration of a cat in the historic <i>Book of Kells</i>, the illuminated manuscript made by the monks on the island of Iona in the eighth or ninth century. Fascinated by this reference I bought a replica bronze statuette of the cat. On the back of the statuette I found the following inscription: 'Cats are both homely and mysterious. They walk silently, mate noisily, they rid us of pests. Their eyes shine in the dark and their pupils change as the moon, from round to crescent. They are sacred to the Moon-goddess and familiars of the feminine.' For me, cats have always been more than just domesticated animals. They have the 'Call of the Wild', which makes them forsake the comfort of their home from time to time to prowl and hunt, preferably in the fields and woods, but also in our gardens, streets and parks. These characteristics fascinate people across the world to the extent that, for many, keeping cats as pets becomes an addiction. With these thoughts and sentiments running through myhead I suddenly felt an urge, almost an obligation, to do something even if it seemed reckless as well as hopeless. At this point Mac, having don*e his deed of mercy with the grey tabby, returned to deal similarly with the two kittens. On a sudden impulse, and to Mac's utter consternation, I scooped up the black-and-white kitten from the table and deposited him carefully into the pocket of my sheepskin jacket. 'You're a sentimental fool,' he said sternly, shocked by my action. 'The wee thing will suffer and die no matter what you do.' 'Well,' I replied, 'he might just as well die in front of my fire as anywhere else. Please send me the bill.' With these hurried words of farewell I left an incredulous Mac shaking his head. His words rang in my ears. 'Sentimental fool,' he'd said. How well I recalled the many times those words had been directed towards me, even by my own father, because of my passionate feelings for wildlife. Struggling with these emotions, I drove slowly home on the snow-packed roads and reflected on the harrowing events of the day. &nbsp; <br> The trip to the vet had followed what began as a normal, dull, grey January day. As I arrived home from work and got out of the car, I felt a heaviness in the air. Living in the country away from the enclosed life of the city had made me far more aware of changes in the weather. By noting howthe sky looked, the direction and strength of the wind, as well as the behaviour of birds and animals, my more experienced eye could forecast fairly accurately if any major changes in the weather were on the way. 'It will snow tonight,' a neighbour remarked as he walked his dog along the footpath past my drive. 'Looks like a storm's coming,' I called back. He smiled and nodded in reply as he was tugged along by Butch, his massive black Labrador. Later, when it did snow, it was heavier than either of us expected. After closing the garage doors I paused by the tall cypress tree to watch the flocks of crows wheeling noisily over their rookery, having returned from marauding the local fields. I loved to watch the sky at this time of day when the soft gentle light of evening slowly gave way to darkness. Sometimes there would be such a subtle toning of colours that the landscape looked like a Turner painting. Alone in my garden at such a moment I could indulge the thought that this was a private viewing for my eyes only. On other days, the colours of sunset would be so boldly red, orange and yellow that they mesmerized me with their beauty. I often reflected that I never had enough time just to watch and appreciate the sky. Tonight, though, there was no sunset - only overcast clouds that gave off a half-light. As I dawdled, the air all around grew still and became electric. I stood spellbound, aware that something eventfulwas about to happen. Then it began to grow darker and I felt a sudden chill. Snow started to fall silently, driving the chaffinches and blackbirds from the bird-table to seek sanctuary in the hedges that fringed the wood at the end of my garden. Despite the cold, I stayed there for a few more moments, witnessing the first snowfall of winter. Suddenly, the tranquil scene changed dramatically and I was nearly swept off my feet by sudden gusts of wind that turned the shower into a blizzard. Covered in huge flakes of snow and numbed with cold, I hastily made for the patio door of the cottage. Once inside, I felt besieged by the storm which was growing stronger by the minute. It rattled the back door and covered the window panes with pale shutters of snow. I shed my overcoat, brushing it free of snowflakes, and hung it to dry in the narrow hall. The sounds of the gale outside grew wilder but this only added to my feelings of safety and comfort inside the cottage. It was Friday and the weekend beckoned with its promise of rest and recreation. Icy draughts from the doors and windows swept around me but failed to dampen my good spirits as I put a match to the log fire and lit the candles around the sitting room. After a hot meal of grilled steak and fried potatoes, I settled down by the fireside with a book and a glass of wine for an evening of homely bliss. I was as yet unaware of the coming turn of events that would shatter my relaxation and change my life for many years to come. The mellow chimes of the French clock striking seven awoke me from an armchair snooze. By this time the storm had moved on and I became aware of an all-pervading stillness. The fire had burned down to roasting hot embers that warmed me right through to my toes and my armchair was, at that moment, the most comfortable place in the whole world. But the particular quiet that comes after a storm is alluring and I couldn't resist the temptation to look outside and sample the night air. The view from my back doorway was bleak but breathtaking. The windblown snow had transformed the familiar scene into a wilderness of pure white. It felt bitterly cold and the air tasted dry and frosted like chilled wine. The sky had cleared and a full moon shone starkly down from a black background of shimmering stars unlike anything I ever saw in the polluted skies of the cities where I had lived for so many years. It thrilled me to imagine again that perhaps I was a solitary witness to this splendour. As far as I could see from my back door, none of my neighbours were sharing the beauty of this night. It was a Christmas-card scene so captivating that it held me there until I realized I was slowly beginning to freeze. I moved to return indoors. Suddenly, the silence was pierced by the scream of an animal. It was a strident cry of pain, totally shattering the stillness that had followed the heavy snowfall. It was frightening and terrible to hear and in the midst of all the beautyaround me it seemed so unreal. I felt as if every sense in my body was switched to full alert. Shocked and alarmed, I strained to find out where it came from. Then I heard it again, a howl full of agony and distress. It sounded close by but I could see nothing. It came again and yet again. This time I thought I knew roughly the location it was coming from. Moving out to get a better view I found myself having to wade through powdery snowdrifts, slipping and sliding in my haste. In spite of shivering in the intense cold I pressed on without a thought for my inadequate clothing. I didn't have a coat on and I was only wearing my carpet slippers. Eventually, I reached the outskirts of the wood that led to Blackbrook Farm. Something squirmed in the snow ahead and wailed with the torment of moving. A silver-grey cat lay twisting and turning in a gin-trap which held it fast by the hind leg. As I approached, the cat's struggles to escape became frenzied and I saw that the snow around it was heavily bloodstained. Shocked and distressed by the sight, I had to find a way to release it, but that proved far from easy. Demented by its injuries and panicked by my presence, it hindered my well-intentioned efforts with a fit of spitting and clawing. Scrambling about on my hands and knees in the snow, I eventually succeeded in prising open the jaws of the rusty trap which had bitten deeply into its leg. To my surprise, despite its severe wounds, the cat took off at highspeed through the snow and was quickly gone from sight. Breathless with exertion and badly scratched and bitten about the hands and arms, I struggled to find a footing on the frozen ground but managed to raise myself up. Still reeling from the shock of this sudden and unexpected experience, at first I didn't know what I should do, if anything. Where had the cat gone? Had it simply headed for the nearest cover? Was it now lying under some fir tree, racked with pain? Cold and wet, I decided to return to the cottage for comfort and medication, as well as time to think. A welcome glass of brandy, some first aid and a roasting in front of the revived log fire did much to restore my spirits. As I thawed out I reviewed the situation. Thinking about what I had seen started to vex me. It was worrying to think about the injured cat and how desperately it needed help. 'I can't just leave things like that,' I said to myself aloud, but it wasn't really any business of mine. Perhaps I should leave it alone. After all, it was getting late and I was tired. Also, it wasn't the weather to go tramping around looking for an injured animal and either a fox or farm dog would most probably have got to it already. Even if the cat survived until daylight, the carrion crows, nature's scavengers, would soon dispatch it and that would be the end of it. Still, I had spent a childhood living with cats and I had a great fondness for them. It was an irritating dilemmafor me but after only a short tussle my conscience won the day and I resolved to try to track and find the cat. What I would do then was a matter for future consideration. Quickly fortifying myself with my sheepskin jacket, the thickest gloves I could find and Wellington boots, I armed my...</p><h2>Loose Girl: A Memoir of Promiscuity</h2><p><em><strong>Kerry Cohen's journey from that hopeless place to her current confident and fulfilled existence is both a cautionary tale and a revelation.</strong></em> <em><strong></strong></em><em>Loose Girl</em> is Kerry Cohen's captivating memoir about her descent into promiscuity and how she gradually found her way toward real intimacy. The story of addiction--not just to sex, but to male attention--<em>Loose Girl</em> is also the story of a young girl who came to believe that boys and men could give her life meaning. Never less than riveting, <em>Loose Girl</em> re-creates what it feels like to be in that desperate moment when a girl tries to control a boy by handing over her body, when the touch of that boy seems to offer proof of something but ultimately delivers little more than emptiness. The unforgettable story of one young woman who desperately wanted to matter, <em>Loose Girl</em> will speak to countless others with its compassion, understanding, and love.</p><p><strong>Kerry Cohen</strong> is a psychotherapist who works with teens and their families. She received her MFA in creative writing from the University of Oregon and an MA in counseling psychology. A mother of two, she is a native of New Jersey but makes her home in Portland, Oregon.Half NPR announcer, half phone-sex operator, Cynthia Holloway treats Cohen's memoir of youthful sexuality and familial disarray with a mixture of breathless eroticism and <i>This American Life</i> deadpan. In either style, Holloway reads intimately, drawing in listeners with her breathy, close-miked voice. There is something icky and quasi-pornographic about having the details of real-life teenage sexuality shared so familiarly, but Holloway's voice&#x2014;knowing, lightly ironic, capable of sounding adolescent while remaining firmly adult&#x2014;salvages the situation. Like those NPR voices, Holloway maintains a crucial distance from the story she shares, immersing herself in the tangled folds of adolescent confusion while indicating, ever so subtly, her separation from it. <i>A Hyperion hardcover (Reviews, Feb. 11).

Based on unprecedented access to the industry, &#34;More Money Than God&#34; provides the first authoritative history of hedge funds. This is the inside story of their origins in the 1960s and 1970s, their explosive battles with central banks in the 1980s and 1990s, and finally their role in the financial crisis of 2007-9. Hedge funds reward risk takers, so they tend to attract larger-than-life personalities. Jim Simons began life as a code-breaker and mathematician, co-authoring a paper on theoretical geometry that led to breakthroughs in string theory. Ken Griffin started out trading convertible bonds from his Harvard dorm room. Paul Tudor Jones happily declared that a 1929-style crash would be &#39;total rock-and-roll&#39; for him. Michael Steinhardt was capable of reducing underlings to sobs. &#39;All I want to do is kill myself,&#39; one said. &#39;Can I watch?&#39; Steinhardt responded. A saga of riches and rich egos, this is also a history of discovery. Drawing on insights from mathematics, economics and psychology to crack the mysteries of the market, hedge funds have transformed the world, spawning new markets in exotic financial instruments and rewriting the rules of capitalism. And while major banks, brokers, home lenders, insurers and money market funds failed or were bailed out during the crisis of 2007-09, the hedge-fund industry survived the test, proving that money can be successfully managed without taxpayer safety nets. Anybody pondering fixes to the financial system could usefully start here: the future of finance lies in the history of hedge funds.</p><p><strong>Sebastian Mallaby on Hedge Funds</strong> <p></p> <p> </p> <p> I set out to write the history of hedge funds for two reasons. Explaining the most secretive subculture of our economy posed an irresistible investigative challenge; and the common view of hedge funds seemed ripe for correction. Hedge funds were generally regarded as the least stable part of the financial system. Yet they managed risk better than banks, investment banks, insurers, and so on&#x2014;and they did so without a safety net from taxpayers. </p> <p> Four years on, the book is done; and both my original motivations have been vindicated. Unearthing the story of hedge funds has been pure fun: From the left-wing anti-Nazi activist , A. W. Jones, to the irrepressible cryptographer, Jim Simons, the story of hedge funds is packed full of larger than life characters. Getting my hands on internal documents from George Soros&#x2019;s Quantum Fund; visiting Paul Tudor Jones and reading the eureka emails he wrote in the middle of the night; poring over the entire set of monthly letters that the Julian Robertson wrote during the twenty year life of his Tiger fund; interviewing Stan Druckenmiller, Louis Bacon, and hundreds of other industry participants: my research has yielded a wealth of investment insights, as well as an understanding of why governments frequently collide markets. Meanwhile, the financial crisis of 2007-2009 vindicated my hypothesis that hedge funds are the good guys in finance. They came through the turmoil relatively unscathed, and never took a cent of taxpayers&#x2019; money. </p> <p> Since the book has come out, many readers have posed the skeptical question: Do hedge funds really make money systematically? The answer is an emphatic yes; and without giving the whole book away, I can point to a couple of reasons why hedge funds do outsmart the supposedly efficient market. </p> <p> First, hedge funds often trade against people who are buying or selling for some reason other than profit. In the currency markets, for example, hedge funders such as Bruce Kovner might trade against a central bank that is buying its own currency because it has a political mandate to prop it up. In the credit markets, likewise, a hedge fund such as Farallon might trade against pension funds whose rules require them to sell bonds of companies in bankruptcy. It&#x2019;s not surprising that hedge funds beat the market when they trade against governments and buy bonds from forced sellers. </p> <p>Second, the hedge-fund structure makes people compete harder. There is an incentive to manage the downside: hedge-fund managers have their own money in their funds, so they lose personally if they take losses. There is an incentive to seek out the upside: hedge-fund managers keep a fifth of their funds&#x2019; profits. This combination explains why hedge funds were up in 2007, when most other investors were losing their shirts; it explains why they were down in 2008 by only half as much as the S&amp;P 500 index. People sometimes suggest that hedge funds survived the subprime bubble by fluke&#x2014;perhaps their ranks include wacky misfits who are naturally contrarian. But there is more to it than that. John Paulson poured $2 million in the research that gave him the conviction to bet against the bubble. The hedge-fund structure created the incentive to make that investment. </p> <p>Financial risk is not going away. Currencies and interest rates will rise and fall; there will be difficult decisions about how to allocated scarce capital in a sophisticated and specialized economy. The question is who will manage this risk without demanding a taxpayer backstop. The answer is hiding in plain sight: To a surprising and unrecognized degree, the future of finance lies in the history of hedge funds. </p> <i>--Sebastian Mallaby</i> <p></p> (Photo of Sebastian Mallaby � Julia Ewan)Sebastian Mallaby is the Paul Volcker Senior Fellow in International Economics at the Council on Foreign Relations and a Washington Post columnist.

She lives in London with her husband and son.</strong></p> <p>How do you solve a problem like the Princes in the Tower? What does a historical novelist do with Edward and Richard, heirs to the British throne who were purportedly locked in the Tower by their uncle and then disappeared so that he could become Richard III? Conspiracy theories have flourished for centuries, but no strong evidence has emerged to solve the mystery. A novelist has any number of possibilities to pursue.</p> <p>In <i>The White Queen</i>, the novel that chronologically precedes <i>The White Princess</i>, Philippa Gregory makes her choice and places their fate in the hands of their feisty mother, Elizabeth Woodville, wife of Edward IV and a key player in the War of the Roses, the dynastic feud among the Plantagenets between the Houses of York and Lancaster. She substitutes a pauper for young Richard, ensuring that the Duke of York gets away. The follow-up to such a dramatic decision inevitably needs to continue this story line. Richard has disappeared. Does he come back?</p> <p>At first, <i>The White Princess</i> seems to tell another story &#x2013; that of Elizabeth of York, the White Queen&#x2019;s daughter, and one-time mistress of Richard III, who on his death becomes the wife of his slayer, the Tudor Henry VII. (Confused yet? I am still reeling at the thought that she was mistress to her uncle!) Elizabeth is the embodiment of the painful transition between York and Tudor monarchies, her strategic marriage to Henry VII the outward expression of York loyalty as demanded by the Tudors.</p> <p>Gregory is known for her retakes on British royal history, viewing the scheming, the power struggles, the battles exclusively from women&#x2019;s points of view, exploring how the Queen or Princess finds her own source of power and influence in the interstices left open by the men. Elizabeth of York is no different, using her beauty, her popularity with the people, her instinctive wiliness and political acumen to bear on Henry VII, with varying results. She may pragmatically have to accept that the Tudors are in the ascendance, but she can see that her distant and paranoid husband is not a natural as a king; she must teach him how to win the love and respect of his subjects, who still view the family of York with affection and nostalgia. </p> <p>Eventually Elizabeth and Henry achieve a kind of marital truce, and grow to love each other, if only for a time. There are plenty of beddings, of ladies-in-waiting with knowing looks, of confinements and wet nurses and babies &#x2013; including, of course, the future Henry VIII, characterized by Gregory even in his boyhood as a sensualist.</p> <p>Inevitably, however, <i>The White Princess</i> is still the story of men, and specifically of the spectre of the lost princes. Does lost Prince Richard return in the form of pretender to the throne Perkin Warbeck (referred to in the novel most often simply as &#x201c;the boy&#x201d;)? Gregory places his identity in Elizabeth&#x2019;s hands, demonstrating the impossible position she is in: acknowledge the boy as her true brother and bring down her husband and any possibility that her sons might become King, or deny him and see her possible brother executed for treason. In this impossible situation, Elizabeth must tread carefully, and Gregory does an expert job of maintaining this tricky balancing act to the very end. Relishing the personality clashes and political machinations of an insecure Tudor court, she makes the current British royal family, with its crystal-clear line of succession, seem very dull indeed.</p>Philippa Gregory is the author of many <i>New York Times</i> bestselling novels, including&nbsp;<i>The Other Boleyn Girl</i>, and is a recognized authority on women&#x2019;s history.

Angela Kirkham Davis writes in 1862 as the events of Antietam swirled about her home; &#34;Lutie&#34; Kealhofer, of Hagerstown, glories in meeting Lee, Longstreet, and Pickett near her home in 1863, only days before Gettysburg; Young Leighton Parks visits General Lee and is given a ride on his horse, Traveller, and Mrs. Howard Kennedy, of Hagerstown, nurses young Oliver Wendell Holmes back to health after Antietam. Also included are the tragic stories of the 125th Pennsylvania&#39;s Color Sergeant, and the little known fate of the tiny Dunker Church at Antietam, and its stolen Bible. From the unpublished diary of Private James Dorrance, Co. A, 7th Maryland Infantry, we learn of camp life, and are saddened by the tragic loss of his best friend in battle. Here, also, is Dr. J. M. Gaines&#39; unpublished list of wounded Confederate soldiers confined to the Hagerstown Seminary Hospital in 1863. These are eyewitness accounts of moments in Washington County history, a piece of the fabric that is altogether American History.</p><p></p><h2>Doctor Strange 1: The Way of the Weird</h2><p>Who do you call when things are coming out of your dreams and trying to kill you?

Churchland, the distinguished founder of neurophilosophy, drew from scientific research on the brain to understand its philosophical and ethical implications for identity, consciousness, free will, and memory. In <em>Conscience</em>, she explores how moral systems arise from our physical selves in combination with environmental demands.</p><p>All social groups have ideals for behavior, even though ethics vary among different cultures and among individuals within each culture. In trying to understand why, Churchland brings together an understanding of the influences of nature and nurture. She looks to evolution to elucidate how, from birth, our brains are configured to form bonds, to cooperate, and to care. She shows how children grow up in society to learn, through repetition and rewards, the norms, values, and behavior that their parents embrace.</p><p><em>Conscience</em> delves into scientific studies, particularly the fascinating work on twins, to deepen our understanding of whether people have a predisposition to embrace specific ethical stands. Research on psychopaths illuminates the knowledge about those who abide by no moral system and the explanations science gives for these disturbing individuals.</p><p>Churchland then turns to philosophy&#x2015;that of Socrates, Aquinas, and contemporary thinkers like Owen Flanagan&#x2015;to explore why morality is central to all societies, how it is transmitted through the generations, and why different cultures live by different morals. Her unparalleled ability to join ideas rarely put into dialogue brings light to a subject that speaks to the meaning of being human.</p> 13 illustrations</p><p><strong>Patricia Churchland</strong> is the author of, most recently, <em>Conscience: The Origins of Moral Intuition</em> and <em>Touching a Nerve: Our Brains, Our Selves</em>.

This lucid translation renders Montesquieu&#39;s problematic text newly accessible to a fresh generation of students, helping them to understand why Montesquieu was such an important figure in the early enlightenment and why The Spirit of the Laws was such an influence on those who framed the American Constitution. Fully annotated, this edition focuses on Montesquieu&#39;s use of sources and his text as a whole, rather than on those opening passages toward which critical energies have traditionally been devoted.</p><p>BARON DE MONTESQUIEU (1689-1755) was a French jurist, satirist, and political and social philosopher during the Enlightenment.

His thrillers have sold more than five million copies in over 25 countries around the world. He lives in Iceland.</p>They were able to guess his age, but had more trouble determining which part of the world he came from.<br><br>They thought he was about ten years old. He was wearing a grey anorak, unzipped, with a hood, and military-style camouflage trousers. His school bag was on his back. One of his boots had come off and there was a hole in his sock. One toe poked through. The boy was not wearing gloves or a hat. His black hair was already frozen to the ice. He lay on his stomach with one cheek turned up towards them, and they saw his broken eyes staring along the frozen earth. The puddle of blood underneath him had started to freeze.<br><br>El�nborg knelt down beside the body.<br><br>&#x2018;Oh my God,&#x2019; she groaned. &#x2018;What on earth is happening?&#x2019;<br><br>She held out her hand, as though she wanted to touch the body. The boy looked as if he had lain down to take a rest. She had difficulty controlling herself, did not want to believe what she saw.<br><br>&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t move him,&#x2019; Erlendur said calmly. He was standing by the body with Sigurdur �li.<br><br>&#x2018;He must have been cold,&#x2019; El�nborg muttered, withdrawing her hand and slowly getting to her feet.<br><br>It was the middle of January. The winter had been reasonable until the New Year, when the temperature dropped sharply. The ground was now covered in a solid coating of ice and the north wind howled and sang around the blocks of flats. Rippling sheets of snow swept along the ground. They collected into little drifts here and there and fine powder snow swirled away from them. Straight from the Arctic, the wind bit their faces and penetrated their clothes, cutting to the bone. Erlendur thrust his hands deep into the pockets of his winter coat and shuddered. The sky was heavy with cloud and it was dark, although it had only just turned four o&#x2019;clock.<br><br>&#x2018;Why do they make military trousers like that for children?&#x2019; he asked.<br><br>The three of them stood hunched over the boy&#x2019;s body. The blue flashing lights of the police cars bounced off the surrounding houses and blocks of flats. A few passers-by had gathered by the cars. The first reporters had arrived. Forensics were photographing the scene, their flashes vying with the blue lights. They sketched the layout of the area where the boy was lying and the immediate surroundings. The forensic investigation was in its initial stages.<br><br>&#x2018;Those trousers are in fashion,&#x2019; El�nborg said.<br><br>&#x2018;Do you think there&#x2019;s something wrong with that?&#x2019; Sigurdur �li asked. &#x2018;Kids wearing trousers like those?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x2019; Erlendur said. &#x2018;Yes, I find it odd,&#x2019; he added after a pause.<br><br>He looked up at the block of flats. People were outside on the balconies watching, in spite of the cold. Others stayed indoors and made do with the view through the window. But most were still at work and their windows were dark. The officers would have to go to all the apartments and talk to the residents. The witness who had found the boy said that he lived there. Perhaps he had been alone and had fallen off the balcony, in which case this could be recorded as a nonsensical accident. Erlendur preferred that theory to the idea of the boy having been murdered. He could not pursue that thought through to the end.<br><br>He scrutinised the surroundings. The garden behind the flats did not seem well kept. In the middle was a patch of gravel that served as a little playground. There were two swings, one broken so that the seat hung down to ground level and spun around in the wind; a battered slide that had originally been painted red but was now patchy and rusty, and a simple see-saw with two little seats made from bits of wood, one end frozen solid to the ground and the other standing up in the air like the barrel of a large gun.<br><br>&#x2018;We need to find his boot,&#x2019; Sigurdur �li said.<br><br>They all looked at the sock with the hole in it.<br><br>&#x2018;This can&#x2019;t be happening,&#x2019; El�nborg sighed.<br><br>Detectives were searching for footprints in the garden but darkness was falling and they couldn&#x2019;t see much on the frozen ground. The garden was covered with a coat of slippery ice, occasional clusters of grass poking through it. The district medical officer had confirmed the death and was standing where he thought he would be sheltered from the gale, trying to light a cigarette. He was uncertain about the time of death. Somewhere in the past hour, he thought. He had explained that the forensic pathologist would calculate the exact time of death by correlating the degrees of frost with the body temperature. On first impression the doctor could not identify a cause of death. Possibly a fall, he said, looking up at the gloomy block.<br><br>The body had not been disturbed. The pathologist was on his way. If possible he preferred to visit the crime scene and examine the surroundings with the police. Erlendur was concerned at the ever-growing crowd gathering at the corner of the block, who could see the body lit up by the flashing cameras. Cars cruised slowly past, their passengers absorbing the scene. A small floodlight was being erected to enable a closer examination of the site. Erlendur told a policeman to cordon off the area.<br><br>From the garden, none of the doors appeared to open out onto a balcony from which the boy might have fallen. The windows were all shut. This was a large block of flats by Icelandic standards, six storeys high with four stairwells. It was in a poor state of repair. The iron railings round the balconies were rusty. The paint was faded and in some places it had flaked off the concrete. Two sitting-room windows with a single large crack in each were visible from where Erlendur stood. No one had bothered to replace them.<br><br>&#x2018;Do you suppose it&#x2019;s racially motivated?&#x2019; Sigurdur �li said, looking down at the boy&#x2019;s body.<br><br>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t think we should jump to conclusions,&#x2019; Erlendur said.<br><br>&#x2018;Could he have been climbing up the wall?&#x2019; El�nborg asked as she, too, looked up at the apartment block.<br><br>&#x2018;Kids do the unlikeliest things,&#x2019; Sigurdur �li remarked.<br><br>&#x2018;We need to establish whether he might have been climbing up between the balconies,&#x2019; Erlendur said.<br><br>&#x2018;Where do you think he&#x2019;s from?&#x2019; Sigurdur �li wondered.<br><br>&#x2018;He looks Asian to me,&#x2019; El�nborg said.<br><br>&#x2018;Could be Thai, Filipino, Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese, Chinese,&#x2019; Sigurdur �li reeled off.<br><br>&#x2018;Shouldn&#x2019;t we say he&#x2019;s an Icelander until we find out otherwise?&#x2019; Erlendur said.<br><br>They stood in silence in the cold, watching the drifting snow pile up around the boy. Erlendur looked at the curious bystanders at the corner where the police cars were parked. Then he took off his coat and draped it over the body.<br><br>&#x2018;Is it safe doing that?&#x2019; El�nborg asked with a glance in the direction of the forensics team. According to procedure they were not even supposed to stand over the body until forensics had granted permission.<br><br>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x2019; Erlendur said.<br><br>&#x2018;Not very professional,&#x2019; Sigurdur �li said.<br><br>&#x2018;Has no one reported the boy missing?&#x2019; Erlendur asked, ignoring his remark. &#x2018;No enquiries about a lost boy of this age?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I checked that on the way here,&#x2019; El�nborg said. &#x2018;The police haven&#x2019;t been notified of any.&#x2019;<br><br>Erlendur glanced down at his coat. He was cold.<br><br>&#x2018;Where&#x2019;s the person who found him?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;We&#x2019;ve got him in one of the stairwells,&#x2019; Sigurdur �li said. &#x2018;He waited for us. Called from his mobile. Every kid carries a mobile phone these days. He said he&#x2019;d taken a shortcut through the garden on his way home from school and stumbled across the body.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll talk to him,&#x2019; Erlendur said. &#x2018;You check whether they can find the boy&#x2019;s tracks through the garden. If he was bleeding he might have left a trail. Maybe he didn&#x2019;t fall.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Shouldn&#x2019;t forensics handle that?&#x2019; Sigurdur �li mumbled to deaf ears.<br><br>&#x2018;He doesn&#x2019;t appear to have been attacked here in the garden,&#x2019; El�nborg said.<br><br>&#x2018;And for God&#x2019;s sake, try to find his boot,&#x2019; Erlendur said as he walked off.<br><br>&#x2018;The boy who found him . . .&#x2019; Sigurdur �li began.<br><br>&#x2018;Yes,&#x2019; Erlendur said, turning round.<br><br> &#x2018;He&#x2019;s also col . . .&#x2019; Sigurdur �li hesitated.<br><br>&#x2018;What?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;An immigrant kid,&#x2019; Sigurdur �li said.<br>The boy sat on a step in one of the stairwells of the block of flats, a policewoman sat with him. He had his sports kit wrapped up in a yellow plastic bag and eyed Erlendur with suspicion. They had not wanted to make him sit in a police car. That could have led people to conclude that he was implicated in the boy&#x2019;s death, so someone had suggested that he wait in the stairwell instead.<br><br>The corridor was dirty. An unhygienic odour pervaded the air, mingling with cigarette smoke and cooking smells from the flats. The floor was covered in worn linoleum and the graffiti on the wall seemed illegible to Erlendur. The boy&#x2019;s parents were still at work. They had been notified. He was dark-skinned with straight jet-black hair that was still damp after his shower, and big white teeth. He was dressed in an anorak and jeans, and holding a woollen hat in his hands.<br><br>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s awfully cold,&#x2019; Erlendur said, rubbing his hands.<br><br>The boy was silent.<br><br>Erlendur sat down beside him. The boy said that his name was Stef�n and he was thirteen. He lived in the next block of flats up from this one and had done so for as long as he could remember.

When Louis Vuitton decided to produce a series of deluxe travel books for the new century they invited only hand picked artists from around the world and placed them in settings unfamiliar to the artists to bring this vision to life. For one of the world&#x2019;s most visited and romantic cities, Venice, they chose Jiro Taniguchi to glorify this magnificent city with his beautifully painted scenes. Being Taniguchi he wove a storyline around the wide open vistas, narrow canals and crowded piazzas of &#x2018;<strong>La Serenissima</strong>&#x2019;. . . <br><br>After his mother&#x2019;s death aged 78, the author discovers a beautifully lacquered box which contains what appear to be old photos and hand-drawn postcards of Venice. One photo of Piazza San Marco particularly catches his eye. It is of a Japanese couple feeding a multitude of pigeons in the square dressed in what looked like 1930&#x2019;s styled clothes. Who were they? What relevance did they have for his mother?<br><br>Armed with the contents of the lacquered box he travels to Venice to track down the places and events displayed in the images and to discover the identity of the young couple in the old photographs. <br><br>With very few but well chosen words and his artist&#x2019;s eye for detail, Taniguchi portrays the Venice of today in a most deserving light. <br><br>Louis Vuitton made a short to introduce the book in which the Taniguchi-san walks through the city sketching and photographing scenes for the book and explains his approach to creating this project.</p> (Jiro Taniguchi)</p><p><p>Jiro Taniguchi August 14, 1947 - February 11, 2017. Born in Tottori, Japan he was heavily influenced by European comic book masters - Moebius, Schuiten, Crespin - he worked together with Sekikawa and Utsumi before creating many solo albums. His work has been much lauded in his native Japan and Europe including top honors for both script and art at the Angouleme Festival in France. He also garnered 5 Eisner Award nominations at San Diego Comic-Con in his lifetime.</p><p>The <strong>Louis Vuitton</strong> "Travel Book" collection is an invitation to real and virtual voyages enriched by intellectual stimulation and poignant moments.</p> <p>In its pages the illustrations of renowned artists or promising young talents tell the stories of the cities or countries they have visited, depicting the varied architecture, maybe the special light of their chosen topic whilst recording the passing days and lives of its people.</p> <p>Heirs of the <strong>Louis Vuitton</strong> "Carnets de Voyage" collection which, for nearly twelve years, captured the urban adventures of a few illustrators and watercolorists, these "Travel Books" offer a new contemporary vision of travel, exploring from the remote wilderness to the cities that never sleep. This fresh approach dares to examine different cultures through the eyes of artists unfamiliar with them. Each artist confronts this unfamiliar place with a viewpoint sharpened by the surprise of the unknown or stimulated by the pleasure of discovery. This vision of a place as a blank, unlined page inspires incisive commentaries that may be narrative, affectionate, satirical or picturesque.</p> <p>Going beyond the pictorial vocation of these travel journals, the collection highlights the rich aesthetic horizons of today's art. The creative worlds on show are highly diverse: during their travels these artists, from various corners of the world, were free to choose their mode of expression and communicate their views of other places through drawing, painting, collage, comtemporary art, illustration, cartoons or manga. Some of the original works born of these journeys, whether figurative or more allusive, have been acquired by <strong>Louis Vuitton</strong> and will join the collection of contemporsary art being put together by the company, enriching it with the diversity of the viewpoints represented.</p> (LOUIS VUITTON TRAVEL BOOK)</p><h2>Dr. Slump, Vol. 1</h2><p>Basking in the glow of his scientific achievement, Senbei scrambles to get Arale in working order so the rest of Penguin Village won&#39;t have reason to suspect she&#39;s not really a girl. But first Senbei needs to find her a pair of glasses and some clothes...</p><p>Renowned worldwide for his playful, innovative storytelling and humorous, distinctive art style, Akira Toriyama burst onto the manga scene in 1980 with the wildly popular Dr. Slump. His hit series Dragon Ball (published in the U.S. as Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z) ran from 1984 to 1995 in Shueisha&#39;s Weekly Shonen Jump magazine. He is also known for his design work on video games such as Dragon Quest, Chrono Trigger, Tobal No. 1, and most recently, Blue Dragon. His recent manga works include COWA!, Kajika, Sand Land, Neko Majin, and a children&#39;s book, Toccio the Angel. He lives with his family in Japan.&#34;Starred Review. The creator of worldwide megahit <i>Dragon Ball</i>, Toriyama is one of the giants of manga. <i>Dr. Slump</i>, which debuted in 1980, is Toriyama's twisted <i>Sesame Street</i>, a slapstick romp with an endearingly oddball cast of characters. Dr. Slump is Dr. Senbei Norimaki ("little rice cracker"). He creates the "perfect" robot in Arale ("even littler cracker"), who looks like an adorable 13-year-old girl. Arale has her faults, though: she's nearsighted, so must wear glasses, and she has some strange habits (e.g., she talks to human waste). She's also strong enough to send a man to another planet with one punch. Dr. Slump, meanwhile, pines for Arale's hot teacher, Ms. Yamabuki. The action takes place in Penguin Village, a small town, which like the Simpsons' Springfield is the gateway to endless comedy. Toriyama has created his own demented sitcom, and his fantastic imagination and comic invention never let up. Simple ideas&#x2014;Arale trying to rescue a bear from the zoo, Slump inventing a "Future camera"&#x2014;spin off into unexpected comic directions, and Toriyama never stints on visual humor (e.g., Arale trying out for various sports teams, Slump trying on x-ray specs so he can see naked women for the first time). The translation is a bit flat, but the uncommonly good storytelling more than makes up for it. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

When the news reached him, Lenin immediately resolved to return to Petrograd and lead the revolt. But to get there, he would have to cross Germany, which meant accepting help from the deadliest of Russia&#x2019;s adversaries. Millions of Russians at home were suffering as a result of German aggression, and to accept German aid&#x2015;or even safe passage&#x2015;would be to betray his homeland. Germany, for its part, saw an opportunity to further destabilize Russia by allowing Lenin and his small group of revolutionaries to return.</p><p> Now, in <i>Lenin on the Train</i>, drawing on a dazzling array of sources and never-before-seen archival material, renowned historian Catherine Merridale provides a riveting, nuanced account of this enormously consequential journey&#x2015;the train ride that changed the world&#x2015;as well as the underground conspiracy and subterfuge that went into making it happen. Writing with the same insight and formidable intelligence that distinguished her earlier works, she brings to life a world of counter-espionage and intrigue, wartime desperation, illicit finance, and misguided utopianism.</p><p> When Lenin arrived in Petrograd&#x2019;s now-famous Finland Station, he delivered an explosive address to the impassioned crowds. Simple and extreme, the text of this speech has been compared to such momentous documents as Constantine&#x2019;s edict of Milan and Martin Luther&#x2019;s ninety-five theses. It was the moment when the Russian revolution became Soviet, the genesis of a system of tyranny and faith that changed the course of Russia&#x2019;s history forever and transformed the international political climate.</p></p><p><b>Catherine Merridale</b> is the author of <i>Red Fortress</i>, which won the Wolfson History Prize; and the critically acclaimed books, <i>Ivan&#x2019;s War</i> and <i>Night of Stone</i>.

In <i>Moral Clarity, </i>she shows how resurrecting a moral vocabulary&#x2014;<i>good </i>and <i>evil, heroism </i>and <i>nobility</i>&#x2014;can steer us clear of the dogmas of the right and the helpless pragmatism of the left. In search of a framework for forming clear opinions and taking responsible action on today&#x2019;s urgent political and social questions, Neiman reaches back to the eighteenth century, retrieving a set of virtues&#x2014;happiness, reason, reverence, and hope&#x2014;that were held high by every Enlightenment thinker. She shows that the pursuit of moral clarity is not a matter of religious faith but is open to all who are committed to these ideals, believers and nonbelievers alike. And she draws on literature, evolutionarytheory, and other contemporary research to show why, by keeping before us the distinction between the real and the possible, these ideals continue to guide and inspire.</p><p><p>"It is a bracing and exhilarating experience to read Susan Neiman's <i>Moral Clarity. </i>Not only does she argue and illustrate the case for moral clarity; in doing so she exemplifies the moral courage and imagination we so dearly need.

Their papers showed the ways in which the human mind erred, systematically, when forced to make judgments about uncertain situations. Their work created the field of behavioral economics, revolutionized Big Data studies, advanced evidence-based medicine, led to a new approach to government regulation, and made much of Michael Lewis&#39;s own work possible. Kahneman and Tversky are more responsible than anybody for the powerful trend to mistrust human intuition and defer to algorithms. The Undoing Project is about the fascinating collaboration between two men who have the dimensions of great literary figures. They became heroes in the university and on the battlefield_both had important careers in the Israeli military_and their research was deeply linked to their extraordinary life experiences. In the process they may well have changed, for good, mankind&#39;s view of its own mind.</p><p>Michael Lewis&#39;s global bestselling books lift the lid on the biggest stories of our times. They include Flash Boys, a game-changing expose of high-speed scamming; The Big Short, which was made into a hit Oscar-winning film; Moneyball, the story of a maverick outsider who beat the system; and Liar&#39;s Poker, the book that defined the excesses of the 1980s. Many of the ideas from these bestsellers underpin his latest book, The Undoing Project, which is the result of years of research. Michael Lewis was born in New Orleans and educated at Princeton University and the London School of Economics. He writes for Vanity Fair magazine.Michael Lewis is a brilliant writer... The Undoing Project is a masterclass in narrative non-fiction -- Steven Poole * Spectator * A new book by Michael Lewis promises an absorbing story, dazzling ideas, journalistic flair and originality. He achieves this with extraordinary consistency. In The Undoing Project he has achieved it again. -- Danny Finkelstein * The Times * Kahneman and Tversky&#39;s deep friendship and intellectual collaboration has arguably done as much to define our world as, say, the intertwining between Francis Crick and James Watson... Michael Lewis, with his great gift for humanising complex and abstract ideas, is exactly the storyteller Tversky and Kahneman deserve. -- Tim Adams * Observer * I normally write two or three pages of notes when reviewing a book. On this occasion I scribbled six, often in high excitement. Lewis has a strong journalist&#39;s sense of a good story and the book is dotted with hundreds. He also has a feeling for pace and intensity. Although this is an easy read, nothing is wasted and everything seems to be in the right place. And what a story it is! -- Bryan Appleyard * Sunday Times * Michael Lewis is perhaps my favourite writer full stop. At his best, Lewis engages both heart and brain like no author, and he tells the story of Tversky and Kahneman beautifully... the final sections will have you weeping -- Robert Colvile * Daily Telegraph * Leaves you feeling cleverer -- Katie Law * Evening Standard * Part biography of a friendship and part account of psychology&#39;s impact, while also taking in much of modern Israel&#39;s history, this is a fine showcase of Mr Lewis&#39;s range ... it is a story of remarkable individuals succeeding through innovative ideas ... Lewis has managed the unusual feat of interweaving psychology and the friendship between two men * Economist * Gripping ... There is war, heroism, genius, love, loss, discovery, enduring loyalty and friendship. It is epic stuff ... Michael Lewis is one of the best non-fiction writers of our time.

Delighted, Louis names him Alphonse and brings him to school for show-and-tell. A diet of cheeseburgers allows the creature to grow by leaps and bounds, and he soon outgrows his jar, the kitchen sink, and the bathtub. Finally, when the high school swim team learns of Alphonse's presence in their pool the hard way, Uncle McAllister gets a call: "'Oh, the wee tadpole?' he said. 'Why, he came from the lake nearby. It's the one folks call Loch Ness.'" Louis's ingenuity (he takes on a paper route to pay for his pet's burgers, and that of his friend the librarian (she thinks they can use the aquatic Alphonse to find pirate treasure and use the money to build him his own swimming pool) are heartwarming and hilarious. Children who are attached to a pet will completely relate to Louis's devotion to his unusual new friend.

A proven way to gain the knowledge to enjoy every stroke you ever take!</p><p>SWIMMING MADE EASY? YOU MUST BE KIDDING! <p>Countless millions around the world would love to be able to swim better -- not fast necessarily -- just efficiently and comfortably. But, for virtually all, swimming well enough to enjoy all its benefits remains an elusive goal. Too bad, because swimming can be uniquely beneficial &#x2013; a non-pounding, joint-friendly fitness activity that exercises the entire body and is suitable for everyone from toddlers to seniors. Being able to swim well is a truly valuable gift &#x2013; and an essential life skill. </p><p>But here's the universal Catch 22: Humans are "hard-wired" to be inefficient in the water. Everything we do instinctively tends to result in clumsy flailing and exhaustion. Swimming really well requires expert instruction; the better the instruction, the more beneficial and satisfying your swimming experience. But traditional swimming instruction is almost universally ineffective, because it focuses on "Human Swimming" technique -- arm and leg churning, which just reinforces our inbred inefficiencies. As a result, "average" swimmers can only watch "good" swimmers with envy, assuming it takes "talent" -- or endless training -- to swim that well. </p><p>The message of Terry Laughlin's groundbreaking new book, Swimming Made Easy, is that swimming well is not a gift reserved for a talented few, but something attainable by everyone. As U.S. Masters Coach of the Year Emmett Hines wrote: "Laughlin makes the effortless grace of elite swimmers accessible to 'average' swimmers with simple, logical, proven steps that make fluid, powerful swimming a HABIT rather than a chance encounter." </p><p>This is the most hopeful message that lap, fitness or competitive swimmers or triathletes have ever heard. Until Laughlin's first book, Total Immersion: The Revolutionary Way to Swim Better, Faster and Easier (1996), all previous books on swimming mainly recycled the same set of misleading and mistaken "rules" about what matters in swimming. They made the improvement process intimidating and confusing, and ultimately resulted in little progress. Laughlin's first book was an instant hit with readers because, as they reported, "It makes sense," and "This really works; I can feel a difference from the first lap." </p><p>Where previous books had mainly prescribed laps and more laps or presented swimming technique as something akin to rocket science, Laughlin advised human swimmers to think and swim more like fish. Fishlike Swimming, as he dubbed his method, focuses on avoiding struggle and turbulence by learning to be balanced and "slippery" and learning to swim fluently before trying to swim far or fast. </p><p>Since publication of the previous Total Immersion book, Laughlin and his associates have taught TI techniques to swimmers of all ages and abilities, from 4 years to 80-plus, from non-swimmers to Olympians and everyone in between. At every level the response has been enthusiastic. As JoAnn Della Torre, a swim instructor in Naperville, IL, said, "You can always spot a TI swimmer by his or her grace and flow." The new book, Swimming Made Easy, details the insights and lessons from thousands of teaching and learning experiences and breaks new ground in making the swimming-improvement process even simpler and more direct. It also provides foolproof steps and learning sequences for learning to be Fishlike in any stroke. </p><p>Here's a sampling of some of the paradigm-smashing information in SME: </p><p>WHAT'S HOLDING YOU BACK? IT'S THE WATER, NOT YOUR FITNESS LEVEL. Lap-based approaches to swimming improvement are doomed to fail because, unless you're efficient to start with, more laps simply make your "struggling skills" more durable. If you can walk, run, or cycle a mile or more, you're fit enough to swim a similar distance. A lack of "swimming fitness" isn&#x2019;t why you run out of gas. It&#x2019;s the way your body interacts with water. Chapter 1 outlines five simple skills guaranteed to help you work with, not against, the water. </p><p>HOW YOU CAN SWIM LIKE AN OLYMPIAN. Your instincts tell you to swim faster by churning your arms faster, but the world&#x2019;s best swimmers are faster because they travel MUCH farther with every stroke than you do, not because they move their arms faster. Chapter 2 explains why Stroke Length is so advantageous and exactly what you can do to get it. </p><p>NO MORE SINKING FEELING. Survival instincts make us want to stay on top of the water: As a result virtually every swimmer spends most of their energy trying not to sink. They think they&#x2019;re pulling and kicking to move forward, but, in reality, their arms and legs are mainly occupied with fighting "that sinking feeling." But, the fact is, our bodies are supposed to sink.. Good balance and body position is the art of sinking in a horizontal position. Chapter 3 tells you how. </p><p>SWIM "TALLER," SWIM EASIER. Most swimmers believe that "stroke technique" means "how you push water back with your hands." Want to swim better? Tweak your armstroke. Want to swim faster? Put more muscle into it. But, hydro-dynamically, the most important thing you can do with your hands is use them to lengthen your bodyline. A longer bodyline reduces drag. Chapter 4 explains how to swim "taller." </p><p>DON'T FIGHT THE WATER, SLIP THROUGH IT. The gospel according to coaches says: "Swimming is hard." The price of speed is "more" and "harder." The gospel is wrong: The one non-negotiable, unavoidable, unyielding limiter of speed is resistance, not your capacity for work. No workout, wet or dry, can overcome the drag created when you try to bully your way through the water. But smart, strategic choices you make in how to "pierce" the water as you swim can reduce drag dramatically. Chapter 5 tells you exactly how to become more "slippery" and Chapters 7 and 8 explain how to generate effortless propulsion. </p><p>A STRONG KICK IS ESSENTIAL. Swimming instructors always start by having you kick and kick and kick some more. No wonder everyone thinks a powerful kick is the key to swimming well -- and then spends countless hours on kickboards vainly pursuing it. In fact, kickboard training does nothing for your swimming, and the best kick is the one requiring the least effort. Chapter 8 explains how to integrate an effortless kick seamlessly with fluent body motion. </p><p>These examples are drawn from just the first half the book. The second half offers a detailed plan, with progressive and sequential how-to steps, that will allow any individual to become their "own best swimming coach."</p>As founder and Head Coach of Total Immersion Swimming, Terry Laughlin has, since 1989, taught more improvement-minded swimmers -- and progressive coaches and teachers -- than any other swim coach in the world. of any other swimming writer.

In this ambitious, incandescent debut, Malcolm Brooks animates that time and untamed landscape, in a tale of the modern and the ancient, of love and fate, and of heritage threatened by progress.<br><br>Catherine Lemay is a young archaeologist on her way to Montana, with a huge task before her a canyon as deep as the devil&#x2019;s own appetites.&#x201d; Working ahead of a major dam project, she has one summer to prove nothing of historical value will be lost in the flood. From the moment she arrives, nothing is familiar the vastness of the canyon itself mocks the contained, artifact-rich digs in post-Blitz London where she cut her teeth. And then there&#x2019;s John H, a former mustanger and veteran of the U.S. Army&#x2019;s last mounted cavalry campaign, living a fugitive life in the canyon. John H inspires Catherine to see beauty in the stark landscape, and her heart opens to more than just the vanished past. <i>Painted Horses</i> sends a dauntless young woman on a heroic quest, sings a love song to the horseman&#x2019;s vanishing way of life, and reminds us that love and ambition, tradition and the future, often make strange bedfellows. It establishes Malcolm Brooks as an extraordinary new talent.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, August 2014:</strong> It&#x2019;s tempting to dismiss Malcolm Brooks&#x2019;s debut as the latest in a series of American epics treading on Cormac McCarthy territory: <em>The Son</em>, <em>Fourth of July Creek</em>, and <em>The Kept</em> come to mind as recent novels dealing with the darker realities of frontiers, both geographical and personal. Like <em>The Son</em>, <em>Painted Horses</em> positions itself at the moment the frontier era gives way to modernity: in mid-century Montana, a dam project threatens to flood a canyon historically inhabited by Native Americans, submerging thousands of years of Crow history under hundreds of feet of slack water. When the inexperienced Catherine Lemay is appointed to survey the canyon for cultural evidence that could thwart the dam-builders, she assumes one corner of a Faustian triangle with a scheming hydroelectric shill and the mysterious John H., a rugged, reticent horse whisperer who opens the secrets of the country to the young archaeologist. Tangled relationships, difficult decisions, and hard compromises ensue. Decades and continents are spanned, and history unfolds. Maybe we&#x2019;ve read this before?</p> <p>But dismissing <em>Painted Horses</em> for its Western tropes would ignore just how good this book is. Brooks's prose is stylistically bold, announcing his artistic aspirations from the opening sentence. His characters are carefully drawn, yet their intentions remain ambiguous enough to be authentically human. His Montana is vivid, wild, and broad, and it&#x2019;s obvious that Brooks lives where he writes, and loves where he lives. Ultimately, Brooks accomplishes no small feat in this remarkable debut: a tale of literary ambition that lives comfortably inside its genre roots, but not by its conventions.<em>--Jon Foro</em></p><b>Malcolm Brooks</b> was raised in the rural foothills of the California Sierras, and grew up around Gold Rush and Native American artifacts. A carpenter by trade, he has lived in Montana for most of two decades.

Murdoch, whose novels wrestle with large philosophical questions, here sets forth her views on art, morality, religion and Eros through imaginary dialogues between Plato, Socrates and sundry fictional characters. She clearly believes that good art tells us more about our lives than any other kind of thought; Acastos's vision triumphs over Plato's hostility to art, a cynic's withering comments and the pragmatic outlook of Mantias, a vulgar Marxist of sorts. In the dialogue on religion, Socrates waxes poetic ("Religion is our love of virtue lightening the present moment"); his almost Buddhist reverence ("God is everywhere") provides counterpoint to Plato's view that religion is a safety valve, a haven of absolutes that keeps us from going crazy and helps us to face life's horrors. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.It should not surprise that Murdoch has chosen the Platonic dialogue for her latest foray into morality, art, and religion. It is, after all, a form she has successfully adapted at strategic points in several novels. The first dialogue, "Art and Eros," depicts a conversation between Socrates and several friends (including Plato) about the definition of art. The second, "Above the Gods," asks many searching questions about mythology, morality, and faith in religion. The dialogues are witty and profound, as one would expect from Murdoch, yet the ideas presented in Acastos have been better worked out, in a truly Platonic sense, in her best novels, such as The Black Prince and A Fairly Honourable Defeat, and in her philosophical work, The Sovereignty of Good.

At least it was&#x2014;until she found herself on the wrong end of a shotgun in the school library. Her suburban high school had become one of those places you hear about on the news&#x2014;a place where some disaffected youth decided to end it all and take as many of his teachers and classmates with him as he could.

In the time it takes to turn a page, to pull your hair back from your face, everything you think you know can vanish, wiped out in an avalanche, erasing everything in its path.</p><p>I was in the library, hunched over my laptop, history notes spread out on the table, the edges crimped from the pressure and heat of my own worried fingertips. Headphones streamed Schubert into the open pink shells of my ears, &#x201c;Death and the Maiden,&#x201d; the vibrato hammering through my body, my limbs tingling with electric shocks. I longed to play it with a quartet, four of us working together in unison, the notes so sharp and clear they could punch a hole in the ozone, make you reel back in your chair. But now I&#x2019;m too advanced of a player to subject my skills to the &#x201c;corrupting influence&#x201d; of my peers&#x2014;or so says Grace, my violin teacher.</p><p>It was still technically winter, snow melting on the ground, but in the last few days the green buds had pushed their way onto the branches of the trees, insistent, and now I could barely concentrate. There was that feeling in the air that happens only at the cusp of spring, a kind of restlessness, a quickening of the blood that made me want to put down my pen and sigh. I had a project due in three days&#x2014;a project I had, as usual, put off till the last minute because I had stayed up most nights that week trying and failing to master the second movement of Brahms&#x2019;s Violin Sonata in D Minor, the tricky mournful bit where the notes seemed to topple over one another like piles of smooth, slippery stones, one clicking against the next so melodiously that you could barely tell when one ended and another began. I&#x2019;d been working on the piece for months&#x2014;I had an audition coming up for the summer orchestra program at the University of Wisconsin, a program so competitive that only twenty students were admitted each June. I wanted it so badly, I was afraid to even speak of it aloud. I tilted my head to one side, stretching my cramped neck as I clicked through photographs of Thailand, hypnotized into stillness by images of mountaintop temples, a gold Buddha smiling benevolently before an altar, a series of copper bowls filled with colored powder in shades of vermillion, magenta, and ochre.</p><p>I bent down to scratch an itch on my calf, pulling out my earbuds in the process, the cord tangled in a mass beneath my chin. At the first crack, my head came up sharply, my gaze meeting that of the girl across from me. Miranda Stillman, blond hair waving against her pink sweater. What I remember of that moment was my own annoyance. I wasn&#x2019;t doing well in history to begin with, and I had to get this paper done or I could kiss what was left of my grade sayonara. In order to get into any kind of decent university music program (I wanted Juilliard, Berklee, days spent with my neck crooked into the oiled wood of my violin, shoulders aching, fingers stiffened and sore), I needed the grades, and so far this semester, I was failing miserably. I didn&#x2019;t see the point of history. What was past was past. Why not focus on the present? The future even?</p><p>&#x201c;Cherry bomb,&#x201d; Miranda said authoritatively, but I noticed that her eyes darted back and forth nervously. A few kids got up and drifted toward the double doors of the library, but then stopped, hovering near the circulation desk. I remember feeling nothing but annoyance. The week before, someone had tossed a smoke bomb into the toilet of the girl&#x2019;s bathroom, sending clouds of gray haze billowing out the windows and door, and we had to stand on the football field in the rain until they figured out it was just a prank.</p><p>There was a sharp bang. Then another. Staccato. Allegro. A series of small popping noises, and a muffled scream coming from somewhere outside the set of large double doors that led out to the quad. I flinched, my body jerking as if I&#x2019;d been hit. Reflexively, my feet felt for my violin case, stashed under the table, my pulse thudding as I made contact with the hard black plastic. Miranda and I just sat there staring at each other. I had never said more than ten words to her before that day. I was an orchestra nerd, and she was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. who? What? I had no real idea. All I knew was that she was a senior, like my brother, Luke, and I was a junior. Close enough in age, but separated by a gulf of experience, friends, cheerleading practice&#x2014;or whatever it was she did. A gap so wide that it seemed impossible to bridge on a daily basis. So no one did. We kept to ourselves, to our friends, our families, our small, tight circles of familiarity.</p><p>With the grind of metal against metal, Keith Rappaport came flying through the double doors, his face flushed tomato red, as if he&#x2019;d been running a great distance. He was slightly pudgy, a freshman, glasses constantly sliding down the bridge of his nose. I remember he was wearing a soccer jersey&#x2014;he must&#x2019;ve had a game that afternoon. He knocked into the circulation desk, and the librarian, Ms. Parsons, looked up with no small degree of irritation. We were always running through the library to get to the other side of campus, perpetually late, always harried, and she despised the constant noise and disruption. It was only 12:30 p.m., and it was clear from the scowl on her face that her day was already ruined.</p><p>&#x201c;Gunshots,&#x201d; Keith said, panting. &#x201c;Somebody has a gun out there. For real.&#x201d;</p><p>Everything seemed to stand motionless, the room freezing into silence, the kind of numbness that creeps up just before terror. I was breathing fast, my fingers tightening around my laptop, which I closed and shoved roughly into my bag. Suddenly, it seemed important to gather my notes and put them back in my binder, to clear the decks. I reached under the table, pulling my violin case to my chest, holding it like a small pet. It was a Matsuda, made in the Cremonese style&#x2014;which just basically meant that it was a very good copy of an Italian violin called a Stradivarius, which could sell for anywhere from fifty thousand to a few million dollars. Even though the Matsuda was a total bargain compared to a Stradivarius, I&#x2019;d heard my parents fighting for weeks over whether or not they could swing it, clapping my hands over my ears to block out the shouts that drifted into my room every night. I&#x2019;d been playing since I was six, and I&#x2019;d long ago outgrown the violin my father had originally bought me at Sutter&#x2019;s, our town&#x2019;s only music store, the worn aisles lined with guitars, cellos, and violins hanging dejectedly against lime-green walls.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care <i>what </i>Grace says,&#x201d; my father had shouted. &#x201c;The bottom line is that we can&#x2019;t afford it.&#x201d; I could almost see the cords on his neck standing out like taut strips of wire, his cheeks reddening. &#x201c;Besides, Luke&#x2019;s off to college next year&#x2014;MIT isn&#x2019;t exactly cheap.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m well aware of that fact, Paul.&#x201d; My mother brushed him off with the dry, sarcastic tone I&#x2019;d heard her use more and more frequently with my father over the past few years. &#x201c;But I do know that if she&#x2019;s going to be a serious musician, then she can&#x2019;t afford <i>not </i>to have it.&#x201d; Her voice echoed through the house with a sharp sense of finality. And with those words, my father grew quiet and, in the days that followed, folded completely, taking out a loan of thirty thousand dollars to augment the cost&#x2014;cheap for a performance-level violin, but still more than we could really afford. Every time I removed the Matsuda from its case, the guilt&#x2014;along with my parents&#x2019; expectations (concert violinist, Lincoln Center alight with applause as I bent forward at the waist in a graceful bow) hung on me like blocks of concrete until I had to lie down on my bed and close my eyes. It was hard, at moments like those, to separate their desire from my own.</p><p>Miranda was suddenly next to me, a glazed look plastered across her nondescript features, an almost blurriness. If you had asked me what she was thinking right then, I would have said nothing. If I was thinking at that point, I wasn&#x2019;t aware of it.</p><p>The cracks got louder and closer, moving stealthily toward us. And the screams.</p><p>People began running, pushing against one another, bodies flailing. It was lunchtime, and the library was always crowded then with kids rushing to finish homework assignments due that day. I watched bodies dive beneath the round tables, binders and laptops still open on tabletops, pages spilling over in a froth of whiteness. Ms. Parsons waved kids over to the fire exit, but I didn&#x2019;t move.</p><p>&#x201c;What do we do?&#x201d; Miranda had gone white, her lips barely moving. For the first time I noticed her fingers clutching my arm. She was wearing dark blue nail polish, her manicure precise, expert. I looked down at my own trimmed and filed nails, comparing them, the cuticles a bit ragged and fraying along the edges. A gold ring wrapped around Miranda&#x2019;s index finger, a tiny ruby chip embedded in the center winking in the overhead light.</p><p>Before I could answer, the doors burst open again, and a figure dressed in black stepped through them. At that moment, an alarm went off, the same one we heard at least twice a year for fire drills, the shrillness ringing in my ears. There was a rifle in his hands, and I stared at the long barrel, the way it parted the crowd without sound, the menacing weight of it. All I could see was the gun, the way it advanced into the room, a sinuous black snake waiting to strike. Miranda&#x2019;s grip on my arm tightened and she pulled me backward.</p><p>&#x201c;C&#x2019;mon!&#x201d; she whispered forcefully. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got to move.&#x201d;</p><p>I knocked into the table, banging my hip, wincing as Miranda pulled me to the ground and we crawled underneath, huddling together, her face buried in my shoulder, my violin falling to the floor. When the gun went off, it was deafening, a volley of thunder. My ears were ringing, a high-pitched whine obliterating everything. A guy named T.J., a senior who had said hello to me in the halls a few times, went down, his body hitting the floor with a thud. I watched helplessly as blood began to pool beneath his head. The muscles in his forearms were fairly developed from tennis, and as the blood seeped across the floor, the pool growing wider, my stomach turned sharply. He landed facedown, one arm flung up beside his head as if to ward off the attack. His fingers twitched spasmodically, then abruptly stopped. The air was clotted with the smell of smoke and scorched cloth, a scent I will always associate with panic and death.</p><p>Miranda sobbed next to me, her hand gripping my arm tight, her words meaningless and nonsensical in my ear, but strangely musical. She was crying so hard, it almost sounded as if she were stuttering, tripping over the insurmountable obstacle of words. The futility of them. A pair of black-booted feet walked by the table, and I held my breath. Then there was the sound of another shot and the screams began again, louder this time. Paper fell from the sky like rain. Loose leaf. An AP Chemistry test came to rest beneath the table, a large <i>98%</i> scrawled at the top in red ink. <i>Good Job, Tony</i> was penned in the left-side margin, and a stifled sob escaped my throat. I heard a small gurgling sound nearby, and crawled to the edge of the table, sticking my head as far out from underneath as I dared without exposing myself entirely. I acted on instinct, blindly, before I could second-guess it at all.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t!&#x201d; Miranda&#x2019;s fingers clutched frantically at my shirt. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll see you!&#x201d;</p><p>Ms. Parsons lay on the floor, one hand holding her chest, her white cardigan soaked with blood. Her mouth opened and closed repeatedly, her eyes staring blankly at the ceiling. The sounds she made were guttural and incomprehensible, a language I couldn&#x2019;t decipher. Ms. Parsons had spent hours helping me with my ninth-grade research project on <i>The Handmaid&#x2019;s Tale,</i> shown me where my locker was on my first day of freshman year when I was too nervous to ask anyone and risk looking like a loser, put aside the endless stacks of sheet music she thought I might be interested in. Brahms. Beethoven. Ravel. Debussy. The names themselves made me feel calmer, more centered, as if nothing could really be wrong in the world. To one day be good enough to play Ravel, to master those intricate chains of notes like beads on a string&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. My head swam with the thought of it, my hands aching for the bow, the faint pine-tree scent of rosin tickling my nose. Sure, Ms. Parsons was cranky and old, but she also kept butterscotch candies in her desk, let us stay after school to work on projects as long as we were quiet, and covered the walls of her small office behind the circulation desk with handmade quilts and pictures of her grandchildren.</p><p>I crawled over to her, my palms skidding away in the slickness of blood, tears that I couldn&#x2019;t feel dripping steadily onto the floor. There were pairs of sneakers running swiftly by my head and jumping over my body, the sound of cries and high-pitched screams, but it was somehow far away, in the hazy distance. I took her slight hand, freckled with age spots, and held it in mine. Her skin was cold and slightly clammy, and I could hear the air moving through her lungs, labored, heavy, and filled with a thick, viscous liquid. I tried not to look at the broken blossom in the center of her chest, the deep red hole of it, the scorched fabric blackened around the stain. Her lips moved soundlessly, and I leaned closer, bending down to her mouth.</p><p>&#x201c;Run,&#x201d; she whispered over and over again, the words melting together in a single entity.</p><p><i>Runrunrunrunrunrunrunrunrunrunrunrunrunrunrunrun&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i></p><p>There was a shadow suddenly above, the light dimming across her face, a sword falling between us, and I turned around and looked up. The fluorescence stung my eyes, wet with salt, and for the first time I saw him: that slightly pointed chin I knew so well, the cheekbones that protruded sharply from the planes of his face. His eyes, usually brown and warm, the color of wet sand, were flat and lifeless. His arms were the first I&#x2019;d ever crawled toward, my knees wobbly against the kitchen floor, his hands now wrapped around cold metal. The fingers, long and expressive, resting on the trigger, had helped build my first sand castle. My brother, with whom I had always felt safe, falling asleep each night to the sound of music drifting from behind the closed door of his room, the soft, jangling guitars he loved creeping slowly into my dreams.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey.&#x201d; He nodded his chin at me, his tone casual, as if we were passing each other in the hallway late at night, the house shuddering in sleep around us.</p><p>My mouth opened, but my words had vanished and I gazed up at him, voiceless, blinking slowly into the light. I couldn&#x2019;t hear my own breathing, my heart pumping away silently. He pointed the gun at me, and I fell into the darkness that stretched out inside the barrel. We stared at each other for what felt like an eternity. If he knew me, I couldn&#x2019;t tell. He was unmistakably my brothe...</p></p><h2>Miss Alaineus: A Vocabulary Disaster</h2><p>Sage has misheard and misunderstood one of Mrs. Page's weekly vocabulary words.

Ruined: <i>destroyed</i>. Finished: <i>brought to an end</i>." Miss Alaineus is not, as Sage determined in her "defective and delirious" mind, "the woman on green spaghetti boxes whose hair is the color of uncooked pasta and turns into spaghetti at the ends." Sage slumps home after the vocabulary bee fiasco, to her mom's comforting, if seemingly impossible words: "There's gold in every mistake." Fortunately, and as always, mothers know best.<p> Debra Frasier (author-illustrator of <i>On the Day You Were Born</i>) has created a masterpiece of clever wordplay in her hilarious and poignant story of the exquisite pain of schoolgirl mortification. One sentence using vocabulary words from A to Z runs along the bottom or side of each page ("Obliterate me, send me to oblivion--no one could outdo my stupidity"). Not just for word-worms, virtually any kid will identify with the occasionally confusing world of learning, and be reassured by the happy conclusion. Frasier's youthful artwork was inspired by her daughter's fifth-grade desk. "No fancy art supplies; just markers, notebook paper, pencils, glue, and scissors." The result is eminently inviting for grade-school children. (Ages 8 to 12) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>The Vocabulary Parade shown in Miss Alaineus has become a national phenomena.

He turned his head toward the set. A nervous tweed pattern buzzed around on the six-foot screen while the air conditioner in the right half of the double window beside it worked full blast to keep the room at seventy.<br>He got to his feet with a groan and shut off the TV. The hiss of white noise stopped. He leaned over and touched his toes, then straightened and rotated his lower spine. His back was killing him. That couch was made for sitting, not sleeping.<br>He stepped to the player and ejected the disc. He&#x2019;d fallen asleep during the closing credits of the 1931&nbsp;<i>Frankenstein</i>, part one of Repairman Jack&#x2019;s unofficial James Whale Festival.<br>Poor Henry Frankenstein, he thought, slipping the disc into its box. Despite all evidence to the contrary, despite what everyone around him thought, Henry had been sure he was sane.<br>Jack located the proper slot in the rack on the wall, shoved&nbsp;<i>Frankenstein</i>&nbsp;in, and pulled out its neighbor.&nbsp;<i>Bride of Frankenstein</i>, part two of his private James Whale Festival.<br>A glance out the window revealed the usual vista of sandy shore, calm blue ocean, and supine sunbathers. He was tired of the view. Especially since some of the bricks had started showing through. Three years since he&#x2019;d had the scene painted on the blank wall facing the windows of this and the other bedroom. Long enough. The beach scene no longer interested him. Perhaps a rain forest mural would be better. With lots of birds and reptiles and animals hiding in the foliage. Yes&nbsp;... a rain forest. He filed the thought away. He&#x2019;d have to keep an eye out for someone who could do the job justice.<br>The phone began ringing in the front room. Who could that be? He&#x2019;d changed his number a couple of months ago. Only a few people had it. He didn&#x2019;t bother to lift the receiver. The answering machine would take care of that. He heard a click, heard his own voice start his standard salutation:<br>&#x201c;Pinocchio Productions&nbsp;... I&#x2019;m not in right now, but if you&#x2019;ll&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>A woman&#x2019;s voice broke in over his own, her tone impatient. &#x201c;Pick up if you&#x2019;re there, Jack. Otherwise I&#x2019;ll call back later.&#x201d;<br><i>Gia!</i><br>Jack nearly tripped over his own feet in his rush to the phone.<br>&#x201c;Gia? That you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, it&#x2019;s me.&#x201d; Her voice sounded flat, almost resentful.<br>&#x201c;God! It&#x2019;s been a long time!&#x201d; Two months. Forever. He had to sit down. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so glad you called.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not what you think, Jack.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not calling for myself. If it were up to me I wouldn&#x2019;t be calling at all. But Nellie asked me to.&#x201d;<br>His jubilation faded, but he kept talking. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s Nellie?&#x201d; He drew a blank on the name.<br>&#x201c;Nellie Paton. You must remember Nellie and Grace, the two English ladies?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, yeah. How could I forget? They introduced us.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve managed to forgive them.&#x201d;<br>Jack let that go by without comment. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the problem?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Grace has disappeared. She hasn&#x2019;t been seen since she went to bed Monday night.&#x201d;<br>He remembered Grace Westphalen: a very prim and proper Englishwoman pushing seventy. Not the eloping sort.<br>&#x201c;Have the police&#x2014;?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course. But Nellie wanted me to call you to see if you&#x2019;d help. So I&#x2019;m calling.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Does she want me to come over?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes. If you will.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Will you be there?&#x201d;<br>She gave an exasperated sigh. &#x201c;Yes. Are you coming or not?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m on my way.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Better wait. The patrolmen who were here said a detective from the department would be coming by this morning.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; That wasn&#x2019;t good.<br>&#x201c;I&nbsp;<i>thought</i>&nbsp;that might slow you up.&#x201d;<br>She didn&#x2019;t have to sound so smug about it.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be there after lunch.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You know the address?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I know it&#x2019;s a yellow townhouse on Sutton Square. There&#x2019;s only one.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell her to expect you.&#x201d;<br>And then she hung up.<br>Jack tossed the receiver in his hand and cradled it on the base.<br>He was going to see Gia today. She&#x2019;d called him. She hadn&#x2019;t been friendly, and she&#x2019;d said she was calling for someone else&#x2014;but she&#x2019;d called. That was more than she&#x2019;d done since she&#x2019;d walked out. He couldn&#x2019;t help feeling good.<br>He strolled through the third-floor apartment&#x2019;s front room that served as living room and dining room. He found the room immensely comfortable, but few visitors shared his enthusiasm. His best friend, Abe Grossman, had, in one of his more generous moods, described the room as &#x201c;claustrophobic.&#x201d; When Abe was feeling grumpy he said it made the Addams Family house look like it had been decorated in Bauhaus.<br>Old movie posters covered the walls along with bric-a-brac shelves loaded with the neat stuff Jack picked up in forgotten junk stores during his wanderings through the city. He wound his way through a collection of old Victorian golden oak furniture that left little room for anything else: a seven-foot hutch, intricately carved, a fold-out secretary, a sagging, high-backed sofa, a massive claw-foot dining table, two end tables whose legs each ended in a bird&#x2019;s foot clasping a crystal sphere, and his favorite, a big, wing-back chair.<br>He reached the bathroom and started the hated morning ritual of shaving. As he ran the razor over his cheeks and throat he again considered the idea of a beard. He didn&#x2019;t have a bad face. Brown eyes, dark brown hair growing perhaps a little too low on his forehead. A nose neither too big nor too small. He smiled at himself in the mirror. Not an altogether hideous grimace&#x2014;what they used to call a shit-eating grin. The teeth could have been whiter and straighter, and the lips were on the thin side, but not a bad smile. An inoffensive face. As an added bonus, a wiry, well-muscled, five-eleven frame went along with the face at no extra charge.<br>So what&#x2019;s not to like?<br>His smile faltered.<br>Ask Gia. She seems to think she knows what&#x2019;s not to like.<br>But all that was going to change starting today.<br>After a quick shower, he dressed and downed a couple of bowls of Cocoa Puffs, then strapped on his ankle holster and slipped the world&#x2019;s smallest .45, a Semmerling skeleton model LM4, into it. He knew the holster was going to be hot against his leg, but he never went out unarmed. His peace of mind would compensate for any physical discomfort.<br>He checked the peephole in the front door, then twisted the central knob, retracting the four bolts at the top, bottom, and both sides. The heat in the third floor hall slammed against him at the threshold. He was wearing Levi&#x2019;s and a lightweight short-sleeve shirt. He was glad he&#x2019;d skipped the undershirt. The humidity in the hall wormed its way into his clothes and oozed over his skin as he headed down to the street.<br>Jack stood on the front steps for a moment. Sunlight glared sullenly through the haze over the roof of the Museum of Natural History far down the street to his right. The wet air hung motionless above the pavement. He could see it, smell it, taste it&#x2014;and it looked, smelled, and tasted dirty. Dust, soot, and lint laced with carbon monoxide, with perhaps a hint of rancid butter from the garbage can around the corner in the alley.<br>Ah! The Upper West Side in August.<br>He ambled down to the sidewalk and walked west along the row of brownstones that lined his street. Along the way he pulled out his Tracfone and dialed his office number, then a four-digit code. A recorded voice&#x2014;not Jack&#x2019;s&#x2014;came over the wire with the familiar message:<br>&#x201c;This is Repairman Jack. I&#x2019;m out on a call now, but when you hear the tone, leave your name and number and give me a brief idea of the nature of your problem. I&#x2019;ll get back to you as soon as possible.&#x201d;<br>After the tone a woman&#x2019;s voice started talking about a problem with the timer on her dryer. Another beep and a man was looking for some free information on how to fix a blender. Jack ignored the numbers they gave; he had no intention of calling them back. But how did they get his number? He&#x2019;d restricted his name to the white pages&#x2014;with an incorrect street address, naturally&#x2014;to cut down on appliance repair calls, but people managed to find him anyway.<br>The third and last voice was unique: smooth in tone, the words clipped, rapid, tinged with Britain, but definitely not British. Jack knew a couple of Pakistanis who sounded like that. The man was obviously upset, and stumbled over his words.<br>&#x201c;Mr. Jack&nbsp;... my grandmother&#x2014;was beaten terribly last night. I must speak to you immediately. It is terribly important.&#x201d;<br>He gave his name and a number where he could be reached.<br>That was one call Jack would return, even though he was going to have to turn the man down. He intended to devote all his time to Gia&#x2019;s problem. And to Gia. This might be his last chance with her.<br>He punched in the number. The clipped voice answered in the middle of the second ring.<br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Mr. Bahkti? This is Jack. You called my office during the night and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>Mr. Bahkti was suddenly very guarded. &#x201c;This is not the same voice on the answering machine.&#x201d;<br>Sharp, Jack thought. The voice on the machine belonged to Abe Grossman. Jack never used his own voice on the office phone. But most people didn&#x2019;t spot that.<br>&#x201c;An ol...</p><h2>Agents of Chaos</h2><p>As Hero&#39;s Trial begins, the New Republic reels beneath the ongoing onslaught of the alien Yuuzhan Vong, leaving dozens of worlds shattered or enslaved.

Louis Renault (Claude Rains) into the mist? This novel. Walsh, a former crime reporter and <i>Time</i> magazine music critic, can't equal the beautiful relationships in the classic film, but he does give us a clever takeoff on the tale, with less romance but much more action. <i>As Time Goes By</i> is both a prequel and a sequel, fleshing out Rick's mysterious life by flashing back to his 1930s New York gangland past and taking us with him, Ilsa, and Sam the piano man as they plot to kill Reinhard Heydrich, the Hangman of Prague. Rick Blaine started out as Yitzik Baline, who learned to shoot in the booze-fueled underworld of Tick-Tock Shapiro and Dion O'Hanlon. A fracas that made Walter Winchell's column explains why Rick wound up in the Casablanca gin joint. Ilsa undertakes to seduce Heydrich--chastely, if at all possible--and set him up for the kill. (He was the only top Nazi the Allies bumped off.) <p> Filled with real history and deductions from the flick, Walsh's book is much smarter than <i>Scarlett: The Sequel to Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind</i>, but purists will prefer to revisit the 50th-anniversary video edition of the film, or read the excellent making-of book <i>Round Up the Usual Suspects</i>. If you crave more heresy, check out <i>As Time Goes By</i>, a novel by Humphrey Bogart's son. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>NOTES ON WRITING AS TIME GOES BY <p>How did I write As Time Goes By? Simple question, tough answer. </p><p>The first part was easy. I rented a video of the Warner Bros. 1942 film classic and watched it. And watched it. And watched it again. Not to weep over Rick and Ilsa's lost love, nor to cheer for Rick and Louis Renault's sudden conversion to the Allied cause in the darkest days of World War II - but for clues. Clues, scattered thick around the script like antiaircraft flak. Clues to the nature of Rick and Ilsa and Louis and Victor Laszlo. Clues that, in most cases, the scriptwriters - there were seven of them in all - weren't even aware they were dropping. </p><p>I kept a notepad handy, jotting down observations and answers that might explain the movie's famous loose ends. Why can't Rick return to America? What is the nature of Victor Laszlo's underground activities? On the eve of Pearl Harbor, where is Laszlo really going when the plane takes off? Why doesn't Strasser just shoot Laszlo on sight? Where are Rick and Louis going at the end of the movie? (Surely not to Brazzaville, thousands of miles away.) Why is Rick, a humble saloon-keeper, so handy with a .45? Why, in fact, is he a saloon-keeper at all? And what about those infamous Letters of Transit, signed by General De Gaulle himself, which, as Ugarte (Peter Lorre) remarks, "cannot be rescinded - not even questioned"? Wy would the Germans honor travel documents endorsed by their archenemy In short, what's going on here? </p><p>That was for me to find out and, now, at last, for you to know. </p><p>This is where it got tricky. A Casablanca successor has long been the Holy Grail of sequels (even though As Time Goes By is neither a prequel nor a sequel, but a combination of both). Previous attempts to expand or rework the material have made the mistake of trying either to reprise the action in the same North African locale or to change the essential nature of the characters, or both. As early as 1943, Warner Bros. was planning a sequel called Brazzaville, written by Frederick Stephani. Stephani's scenario, which never got beyond the planning stage, supposed that Rick and Renault had been working for the underground all along, thus negating both Renault's political conversion and Rick's personal sacrifice - two of the plot elements that have made Casablanca so enduring. </p><p>In his own 1988 attempt at a sequel, Howard Koch, one of the original screenwriters, moved the action forward a generation, inventing an illegitimate son for Rick and Ilsa (never!), who returns to Morocco to try to learn what happened to his father. The 1955-56 television series Casablanca, which lasted seven months, trapped Rick Blaine in his Caf Americain forever "as a North African Mr. Fix-it," as Aljean Harmetz noted in her book Round Up the Usual Suspects Another. Another TV version, in 1983 starred David Soul as Rick; it lasted only three weeks. The shoals of Casablanca are dangerous waters indeed. </p><p>From the start, therefore it seemed to me the only way to approach the task was to treat the source with the utmost respect, rather in the manner of the Baker Street Irregulars examining the canon of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock HoImes stories. I posited that the people and events in the movie were all "true," and drew conclusions about Rick, llsa, and the rest of the gang from there. </p><p>After watching Casablanca at least fifty times, I then read every book on the subject that I could get my hands on, from Round Up the Usual Suspects to such obscure German-language publications as Wer war wer im dritten Reich (Who was who in the Third Reich), to get a better idea of the lineage of Major Strasser and his cohorts. </p><p>Almost immediately, the guiding principle of the novel became clear: to understand where the characters are going when Casablanca ends, I had to know who they were and where they had come from. As Time Goes By, then, had to be not merely a sequel to the movie, but a kind of frame around it: imagine the film elongated at either end to reveal the epic, wide-screen version, of which the events depicted in Casablanca are but the middle of the story. </p><p>Everything else flowed from this realization. Some of the questions had obvious answers. Since a hallmark of Rick Blaine is his cynical honesty, I chose to take at face value his answer to Captain Renault - "it was a combination of all three" - when the police captain grills him about why he cannot go home, and suggests embezzlement, a love affair, and murder. (The closest Major Strasser ever gets to the truth is "the reasons are unclear.") Victor Laszlo's real mission is so obvious from the hints dropped in the film that it is a wonder no one has ever noticed it before. When it comes to the De Gaulle letters, though, I gave up: after dozens of replays and freeze-frames of Peter Lorre's comment - "signed by General XXXXX himself" I still cannot tell whether he says "De Gaulle" (as is popularly supposed) or "Waygand" (as the screenplay has it). Maybe he says both. Don't even ask who General Waygand was. </p><p>In other words, all of the action of As Time Goes By, both front and back story, derives from statements or clues in the screenplay that, when examined, are the only logical explanation for what happens in the movie, Casablanca. </p><p>No one reading this book can fail to envision Humphrey Bogart as Rick, Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa, Paul Henreid as Laszlo, or Dooley Wilson as Sam. Accordingly, I have embraced the material's cinematic source, right down to incorporating selected dialogue from the script into the novel, partly in homage, partly from dramatic necessity, and partly to let the reader know that the author is in on the fun, too. Rick's bitter wisecracks, Laszlo's lofty pronouncements. Sam's wise empiricism, and Ilsa's passion and confusion all find their source in Casablanca. </p><p>One bit of film business I have incorporated is the incessant smoking and drinking of nearly all characters. In the movie, a cigarette or a drink appears in almost every scene, just as in As Time Goes By. We may look askance at behavior we regard as antisocial and self-destructive (Bogart died of the effects of alcohol and tobacco at age fifty-seven), but the social attitudes of half a century ago were very different and have been faithfully reflected here. Besides, the two-pack-a-day, three-martini-lunch generation not only overcame the Depression, but won World War II. How's that for political correctness! </p><p>A final word: although the action of the book takes place in the '30s and '40s, the novel is written in the late 1990s. Thus it was important to enlarge the scope of action for several of the characters, most notably Ilsa and Sam, while maintaining plausibility. Dramatically, Ilsa needs to be more than simply the object of desire and competition between Rick and Laszlo, but she cannot grab a Tommy gun and start shooting Nazis. Similarly, the spirit of Sam's dialogue, which in the original script verges on dialect, must be maintained, but there is no reason not to give him a far richer inner life than is apparent in Casablanca not to mention a considerable, indeed crucial, role in Rick's activities in the back story. </p><p>In the end, the reader will decide whether I haste succeeded in my attempt to breathe new life into the characters of the most beloved motion picture in fi1m history. My wish for As Time Goes By, though, is simple. When you are finished I want you to say: yes, now I understand. That's the way it was. And that's the only way it could have been.</p></p><h2>The Cold War Swap (Mac McCorkle, Book 1)</h2><p>McCorkle crosses over into the Soviet Bloc in search of his friend Michael Padillo, a part-time tavern owner and full-time spy who has disappeared in East Germany</p><p><p><b>Ross Thomas</b> is ranked as one of the very top thriller writers by his fellow authors, and his readers loudly agree.

Murder cases have the highest stakes and the biggest paydays, and they always mean Haller has to be at the top of his game.<br><br>When Mickey learns that the victim was his own former client, a prostitute he thought he had rescued and put on the straight and narrow path, he knows he is on the hook for this one.

Far from saving her, Mickey may have been the one who put her in danger.<br><br>Haunted by the ghosts of his past, Mickey must work tirelessly and bring all his skill to bear on a case that could mean his ultimate redemption or proof of his ultimate guilt. <i>The Gods of Guilt </i>shows once again why "Michael Connelly excels, easily surpassing John Grisham in the building of courtroom suspense" (<i>Los Angeles Times</i>).</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, December 2013:</strong> What distinguishes Connelly's Lincoln Lawyer books from the average legal thriller (in the same way his Harry Bosch series transcends "cop story") is the complicated likeability of his flawed hero, Mickey Haller, a criminal defense lawyer who works mostly from the backseat of a chauffeured Lincoln Town Car. In <em>The Gods of Guilt</em>, Haller agrees to defend a former client's pimp on a murder charge, and his messy past comes back to taunt him--an ideal introduction to Haller for newcomers, and catnip for fans. As a former newspaper court reporter, I've always appreciated Connelly's attention to the messy particulars of the legal system, and his ability to convey real courtroom drama, the humanity and inanity of bringing criminals to justice--or not. (The title refers to the imperfect judgment of a jury.) Like his peers, Laura Lippman and George Pelecanos, Connelly writes crime fiction verging subversively on literature, and Haller is becoming an increasingly complex literary figure, cruising LA's darkest corners in a style that feels like a modern twist on <em>Chinatown</em>. (Think Clint Eastwood-Dirty Harry-San Francisco, but in LA, and without the big guns and the unresolved anger.) Incredibly, Connelly just keeps getting better. --<em>Neal Thompson</em>Michael Connelly is the author of twenty-five previous novels including the New York Times bestsellers The Black Box, The Drop, The Fifth Witness, The Reversal, &#34;The Scarecrow,&#34; &#34;The Brass Verdict,&#34; and &#34;The Lincoln Lawyer, &#34; as well as the bestselling Harry Bosch series of novels.

She fell in with a fast crowd, and her dreams of modelling soon landed her a spectacular centrefold in Penthouse magazine, where at 15 she became internationally known as 'Traci Lords'. From there she appeared in numerous adult films and magazines, denying her past and battling a deep addiction to cocaine and men. Three years later she got out. This is her memoir &#x2013; a tale of loss, redemption, and ultimate survival as Traci Elizabeth Lords takes you into her secretive past, faces her demons, and shares her extraordinary journey of personal growth. </p><p> Snippets of Traci's story have been told here and there, but this book will set the record straight. What happened to her as a child to make her pursue a porn career? Why was she blamed as the person who brought down porn in the late 1980s? How many sex movies did she really star in? Why did she quit? There's more misinformation floating around about Traci Lords than almost anyone. This book sets the record straight. </p><p> </p></p><p>Nora Kuzma was a troubled teenager from Steubenville, Ohio; Traci Lords was the underage skin mag/porn queen who became the centerpiece of the adult video industry's greatest scandal. In reality, they were one and the same, the subject of this slick, if thin autobiography. But what's striking here is not the familiar storyline--confused, sexually abused teen falls in with drugs and the wrong Southern California crowd, forges fake IDs to become <i>Penthouse</i> Pet of the Month at 16 and the '80s hottest adult star, then arrested as focus of the Reagan administration's crackdown on porn, only to become reborn as cleaned-up, psychoanalyzed/rehabed purveyor of legitimate film, TV, and music career. Rather, what's striking is Lords's capacity for denial, compartmentalization, and myopia when it serves her ends. <p> </p><p> Her scandalous tenure in the skin trade--undeniably the sole basis for her infamy and subsequent legitimate career--is glossed over here in a few score pages, with more attention paid to the heavy-metal musicians that dotted her life than the motivations and machinations of the Feds who literally changed her life; Slash's snake gets more ink here than Attorney General Ed Meese. Quick to ladle generous sympathy on her own plight, she heaps little but scorn upon those from the seedy past of her porn-star alter-ego, yet seems to have had few qualms about formally adopting that moniker as her legal name. <i>--Jerry McCulley</i></p><p>Traci Elizabeth Lords has starred in dozens of films and television shows, including <em>Cry-Baby</em>, Stephen King's <em>The Tommyknockers</em>, <em>Melrose Place</em>, and <em>First Wave</em>. Her groundbreaking album 1,000 Fires was a critical and dance club hit. She lives in Los Angeles with her husband and two cats.

It instantly became a sizzling, international bestseller that lanced the boil of Windsor family dysfunction, triggering a chain of events that led to Charles and Diana's divorce. After her tragic death in 1997, Andrew Morton revealed that Diana herself had not only been the main source for the book, but had also edited his original drafts for accuracy. In return for this gold mine of information, Diana wanted complete anonymity for fear of retaliation from the queen. <i>Her True Story in Her Own Words</i> is enhanced by more than 75 full-color photographs of the princess, from her childhood in Althorp to her marriage to Charles at Westminster Abbey to her humanitarian efforts, and finally to her unforgettable funeral service. However, the most poignant portrayal of the princess emerges from the unedited transcriptions of Diana's interviews with Morton: "I think I'm going to cut a very different path from everyone else. I'm going to break away from this setup and go and help the man on the street."<p>The sudden and tragic death of Princess Diana has caused the entire world to reflect on how much this singular woman meant to us all. From her fairy-tale courtship, her wedding to Prince Charles, and the birth of her two wonderful boys to the stunning collapse of her marriage and the revelation of her psychological and physical trauma, we witnessed and shared in the wide range of emotions in her life. In the last few years, Diana's dedication to the downtrodden and unloved and her commitment as a mother have only strengthened her hold on our hearts. </p><p>When <i>Diana: Her True Story</i> was initially published in 1992, it was met with a hail of abuse from the British Establishment. As time passed, however, the magnitude of Diana's marital and personal distress made it clear, even to the greatest doubters, that this book was indeed Diana's true story; and finally, in 1995, she revealed in a BBC interview that she had indirectly cooperated with Andrew Morton. </p><p>What has not been known, however, until the publication of this new edition, is that <i>Diana: Her True Story</i> was in fact almost entirely based on her own words, supplemented by interviews with her friends. In 1991 and 1992, when this book was first conceived and written, Diana felt trapped and powerless within the royal family. She knew that the truth about her life was submerged under a mountain of royal propaganda. <i>Diana: Her True Story</i> chronicles Diana's unhappiness, which began shortly before her wedding day, and reveals the life of a young and beautiful woman who, trapped in a loveless marriage, had sunk to the depths of despair; from which recovery seemed impossible. In an act of desperation, she made the decision in 1991 to tell her own story, no matter what the cost. And so she and Andrew Morton began a collaboration that was to shake the royal family to its foundations and, eventually, force Diana to seek a new life. Tragically, that new, and briefly happy, life is over. </p><p>This new edition contains the story of how the book first came into being. What's more, Diana is able, finally, to tell her own story, in her own words. Its pages contain her own testament -- the closest we will ever come to her autobiography.</p></p><h2>Preserving in Today&#39;s Kitchen: Easy, Modern Canning Methods-With 168 Recipes</h2><p>Demonstrates how to spice up bland dishes by using preserves instead of rich sauces, and features recipes for jellies, chutneys, pickles, and salsas</p><p><i>Preserving in Today's Kitchen</i> is the paperback version of Jeanne Lesem's <i>Preserving Today,</i> which was published in hardcover in 1992. It won a James Beard Foundation award in recognition of Lesem's canning methods, which are creatively suited to today's fast-moving life and smaller households: most of the recipes make one to four cups; some call for using the microwave or a Crock-Pot to streamline the cooking process; and many items can be refrigerated or frozen, bypassing the bother of a hot-water bath. Along with traditional favorites such as strawberry jam, there are recipes for Dried Apricot Jam, Peach Melba Jam With Raspberries, and Cantaloupe Pickles. The Reduced-Fat Tomato Orange Marmalade, Salt-Free Dill Pickles, and Homemade Tomato Paste are as appealing as Lesem's more classic treats.&#x201c;Those intimidated by making their own preserves will welcome this helpful guide, which is geared to cooks with busy schedules who enjoy fresh new flavors . . .

First published in 1952, the book has the advantage of the author's extensive interviews with participants from all sides of the conflict, when recollections of the war were still painfully fresh. The pattern of post-war Europe, he maintains, was determined during the fighting; he sees the shaping events through a study of wartime diplomacy and strategy and of the impact on wartime policies of the personalities of the statesmen and generals with whom the decisions lay. Throughout Wilmot hews to one guiding principle: To concern ourselves solely with the course of military events would be to tell only half the story and to see only half its significance. It is the political outcome that counts, and in this book the two are closely related at every stage.</p><p>Wilmot offers a journalistic view of the struggle to liberate Europe from the iron grip of the Third Reich. He follows the Allied efforts from the buildup to the Normandy invasion to the long, hard push through Europe, the assassination attempts against Hitler by his own commanders, and the final defeat.

Slavishly obsequious to his master, Vyshinsky was a first-rate actor and virtuoso stage-manager who orchestrated countless "confessions" from innocent victims. Bolsheviks, eniment doctors and teachers, military men, bureaucrats, intellectuals--all were branded criminals or traitors and sent to death squads or labor camps. Adroitly outlasting Stalin, Vyshinsky went on to become a Soviet delegate to the U.N. His death in 1954 was mourned with solemnity by that international forum. In drawing on KGB files to limn this sinister butcher with dispassionate calm, Vaksberg, a Moscow journalist and vice-president of the Soviet chapter of PEN, fleshes out a dark chapter of Soviet history.

The police are faced with more questions than answers including what do the mysterious deposits of blood mean, coming as they do from three additional unknown people. In their search for the elusive truth, the VBI must plumb the depths of every suspect&#x2019;s past, every victim&#x2019;s most intimate details, and examine each piece of evidence down to the smallest detail&#x2014;an examination which includes a trip to the Brookhaven National Lab on Long Island and an exploration of cutting edge forensic technology.</p><p>ARCHER MAYOR is a death investigator, a sheriff&#x2019;s deputy, and a volunteer firefighter and EMT in addition to being a novelist. He lives in Newfane, Vermont.CHAPTER ONE<br>Doreen Ferenc slipped her nightgown over her head and let it fall the length of her body and gently settle onto her shoulders. This was the reward of every day, this threshold moment, when, as though dropping a heavy burden, she exchanged her regular clothing, complete with belts, buttons, zippers, and elastic, for the sensual, almost weightless comfort of a simple shift of light cotton.<br>Not that the day had been more onerous than usual. Her mom had been in good spirits, minimally judgmental of the nursing-home staff. They'd served Indian pudding for lunch, a perennial favorite. Her mother had once been an expert at the dessert, and it had led them both down a path of happy memories while they'd worked on the quilt for Doreen's new nephew. Doreen's brother, Mark, had recently married a much younger woman in Nevada, where they lived, and she'd just delivered their first child.<br>Doreen and Mark weren't particularly close, as siblings went, but they got along, and their mom loved them both. She preferred Mark, as Doreen well knew, but only because he was in a position to present her with a grandchild. Doreen had never found marriage appealing, and by and large didn't like kids, which, thank God, she was now safely beyond having anyway. The quilt had become a salutary talisman of good tidings to which Doreen could contribute guilt-free.<br>She left the bedroom in her bare feet and dropped her clothes into the laundry hamper in the darkened bathroom, pausing a moment to admire the unexpected snow falling from the night sky onto the enormous skylight she'd spent too much money having installed. The house was an almost tacky prefab ranch&#x2014;virtually a trailer with pretensions&#x2014;but she knew in her heart that it was also the house she'd most likely die in, so why not splurge a little, like on the skylight and the heat she poured on to make the whole house as toasty as in mid- July? She loved winters in Vermont, including flukily premature ones like this year's. She'd known them her whole life, and had, at various times, enjoyed skiing, snowball fights, and even shoveling the driveway. But no longer. Now she just wanted to watch the weather from the comfort of an evenly heated, boring modern house that was fussed over by a handyman complete with a snowplow&#x2014; assuming he'd attached the plow to his pickup by now. She had started working full-time at seventeen, decades earlier, and now she was going to enjoy all the fruits of a slightly early retirement.<br>Entertaining such thoughts, she pursued the next step in her nightly routine, and entered the small kitchen. There, she dished out a single scoop of vanilla ice cream, splashed an appreciable quantity of brandy over its rounded top, and retired to the living- room couch, which was strategically angled so she could watch TV from a reclining position.<br>It was snowing&#x2014;heavily, too&#x2014;and only October. People hadn't switched to snow tires, sand deliveries were still being made to town road crews, and cars were going to be decorating ditches all over the state by morning. But Doreen didn't have to care about any of it. She was as snug as the proverbial bug.<br>Settled at last, she hit the remote, dialed in her favorite channel, and heard the doorbell ring.<br>&#x201c;Damn,&#x201d; she murmured, glancing at the digital clock on the set. It was just before ten p.m. &#x201c;Who on earth?&#x201d;<br>She placed her bowl on the coffee table, struggled up from her place of comfort, and sighed heavily as she crossed the room to the tiny mudroom and the front door beyond it.<br>Enclosing herself in the mudroom to preserve the heat, she slipped on an overcoat from the row of nearby pegs, hit the outside light, and called out, &#x201c;Who is it?&#x201d; She could see the outline of a man standing before the frosted glass of the door.<br>A weak voice answered, &#x201c;You don't know me, ma'am. My name's Lyle Robinson. I've just wrecked my car about a half mile up. I was wondering if I could use your phone.&#x201d;<br>So much for keeping immune from the woes of poor weather. She then heard him cough and bend over as he clutched his chest.<br>&#x201c;Are you all right?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I think so, ma'am. I wasn't wearing my seat belt, like a damn fool ... Sorry. Don't mean to offend. I think I just bruised my chest, is all.&#x201d;<br>She hesitated.<br>&#x201c;Ma'am?&#x201d; he said next. &#x201c;Not that it'll matter, but I'm a cousin of Jim and Clara Robinson. They used to live just outside Saxtons River. I don't know if you know them.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I do,&#x201d; she blurted out. &#x201c;So, you're related to Sherry?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, ma'am, although what she's doing way out west is beyond any of us.&#x201d;<br>Doreen threw open the door.<br>She was only aware of two things after that: the bare blade of an enormous knife, held just two inches before her eyes, and, behind it, a man disguised by a hooded sweatshirt worn backward, two holes cut in the fabric for his eyes. She now understood why his voice had sounded weak.<br>&#x201c;Okay, Dory,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Drop the coat and step back inside. You and I are gonna get acquainted.&#x201d;<br>Excerpted from Red Herring by Archer Mayor.<br>Copyright � 2010 by Archer Mayor.<br>Published in 2010 by St. Martin's Press<br>All rights reserved.

After a rambunctious youth and series of short-lived jobs including door-to-door salesman, accountant, a peddler for a quack alcoholism cure and finally pencil sharpener wholesaler, Burroughs found his calling as writer. As the story goes, one of Burroughs&#39; duties was to verify the placement of advertisements for his sharpeners in various magazines. These were all-fiction pulp magazines, a prime source of escapist reading material for the expanding middle class. Burroughs spent time reading those magazines and decided he could write those stories just as well. He was lucky his first time out and sold Under the Moon of Mars. The Tarzan series followed this and Burroughs was now a full-fledged writer. Now, surrender yourself to Tarzan&#39;s exploits in the damp African Jungle, yield to the pull of primitive impulses as your imagination goes back again in prehistoric times, swinging from tree to tree in glorious abandon through the primeval forest or fighting the great cave bear with rude stone weapons. Tarzan and the Ant Men will hold you as spellbound as any of the previous stories.

Born in London of mixed Jewish and English parentage, and a much photographed beauty, she moved in the pivotal circles of international modernism - in Florence as Gertrude Stein&#39;s friend and Marinetti&#39;s lover; in New York as Marcel Duchamp&#39;s co-conspirator and Djuna Barnes&#39;s confidante; in Mexico with her greatest love, the notorious boxer-poet Arthur Cravan; in Paris with the Surrealists and Man Ray. Carolyn Burke&#39;s riveting, authoritative biography brings this highly original and representative figure wonderfully alive, in the process giving us a new picture of modernism - and one woman&#39;s important contribution to it.</p><p>Altering her family name, wearing the clothes she wanted (which she designed herself), encouraging nudity among her children, writing about sex, and befriending derelicts were among the life achievements of English poet Mina Loy (1882-1966). Loy emerged out of a tortured childhood into the age of free love and expression in Europe and America with irrepressible force. Though her behavior was at times reproachable, such as when she dumped her children in Florence to go gallivant among the elite in New York, her story is always interesting.

Clearly everyone forgot the warnings buried deep in the quatrains of Nostradamus-- the end of days. When the world they know is destroyed, will their struggle to survive destroy their love?

But, as I lifted the glass and drank it with glugging pleasure, my raised eyes drifted across the clock that was set into the wall above the bar.It was just ten in the morning."My, my, Jim, you are hitting the sauce a little earlier each day," I growled wordlessly. So what? It was my liver wasn't it? I gurgled the glass empty just as the house computer spoke to me in rich, educated--and possibly sneering?--tones."Someone is approaching the front door, Sire.""Great. Perhaps it is the booze shop delivery?" Venom dripped from my voice; but all computers are immune to sarcasm."Indeed not, Sire, for Garry's Grog and Groceries delivers by freight tube. I identify the person approaching as Rowena Vinicultura. She has stopped her popcar on the front lawn and is emerging from it."My morale plummeted as the name slithered across my eardrums. Of all the beautiful bores on Lussuoso, Rowena was possibly the most beautiful--and certainly the most boring. I had to flee--or commit suicide--before she came in. I was alreadyheading for the back of the house, to possibly drown myself in the swimming pool, when the housebot's computer voice stopped me in my tracks."Ms. Vinicultura appears to have fallen down onto the plastic mat outside the door that spells out WELCOME in six languages.""What do you mean <i>fallen?"</i>"I believe the description is an apt one. She closed her eyes and her body became limp. Then she descended slowly towards the ground and is now lying, unmoving, with her eyes still closed. Her pulse appears to be slow and irregular as detected by the pressure plate in the mat. Lacerations and bruises on her face ..."The thing's voice followed me as I ran back through the house."Open the door!" I shouted. It swung wide and I dived through.Her cameo face was pale, her dark hair tousled gracefully, her ample bosom rising and falling slowly. There was blood on her cheeks and a darkening bruise on her forehead. Her lips moved and I leaned close."Gone ..." she said, barely audible. "Angelina ... gone ..."It felt as though my body temperature had dropped thirty degrees. This did not slow me in the slightest. While I was still reaching down for her I managed to tap the number 666 into my wrist communicator."Where is the home medical treatment center?" I shouted as I slipped my arms under warm thighs, soft back, and lifted her as carefully as I could."The settee in the library, Sire."I ran, ignoring the cold knot of despair her words had punched into me. Since both Angelina and I were strenuously healthy we had never used the medical services in this house. I had glanced at the specs when I signed the rental agreement; . with the price we were paying, the medical arrangements should equal that of a provincial hospital at least. By the time I had carried Rowena to the library the settee had vanished into thewall and an examining bed had risen in its place. Even as I laid her on the bed the detectors were snaking down from the medbot that had popped out of the ceiling. An analyzer fastened onto the back of my neck and I slapped it away."Not me! Her, on the bed, you moronic machine."I stepped back out of reach while it set to work with mechanical enthusiasm. A glistening row of readouts sprang to life on the screen. Everything from temperature and pulse to endocrine balance, liver function, hair-follicle growth and anything else that could be measured or assessed was there."Speak! Tell!" I commanded and there was a rustle of electronic activity as the various expert programs shuffled and sorted their input, compared and interacted and agreed on the results in a speedy microsecond."The patient is concussed and contused." The computer-generated voice was deep, male and reassuring. "The bruises are superficial and have been cleansed and sealed," there was a scurry of flashing apparatus, "and the appropriate antibiotics injected.""Bring her to!" I snapped"If you mean, sir, that you wish the patient restored to consciousness that is now being done." If a computer can sound miffed--this one was miffed."Whasha?" she muttered, blinking lovely purple eyes that were blurrily out of focus."You've got to do better than that with her," I said. "Stimulants, something. I must talk to her.""The patient has been traumatized ...""But not badly--you told me that. Now get her to talk, you overpriced collection of memory chips or I'll short-circuit your ROM, PROM and EPROM!"This seemed to do the job. Her eyes blinked again and looked at me."Jim ..."In the flesh, Rowena my sweet. You're going to be fine. Now tell me about Angelina.""Gone ..." she said. And fluttered her luxurious eyelashes.I felt my teeth grating together and forced a smile."You said that before. Gone where? Gone why? Gone when--" I shut up since I was getting into a rut."The Temple of Eternal Truth ..." was all that she said as her eyes closed again. It was enough.I shouted to the housebot as I bolted out the door."Cure her. Guard her. Call an ambulance."I did not mention the police since I didn't want their flat-footed presence interfering with my investigation."Switch on!" I shouted to the atomcycle as I jumped into the garage. "Door open!"I landed in the saddle, hit full power and tore off the bottom half of the garage door, it wasn't opening fast enough, as we burst through it. I managed to miss a strolling couple on the pavement, shot between two vehicles and roared down the road. Shouting into the atomcycle's phone since it would be nice to know where I was going."AdInfo, emergency access. The Temple of Eternal Truth--coordinates."A street map was projected onto the now-cracked windscreen and I screeched tires around the first corner. As I straightened out I saw that the com light was blinking. It could only be an answer to my emergency call since only Angelina, James or Bolivar could access this number after that call went out."Angelina is that you?!" I shouted."Bolivar here. What's up, Dad?"I explained briefly and curtly, then repeated myself when James signed on. I had no idea where they were--I would find out later--but it was enough to know that they were informed and on the way. This was the first time we had used the 666 call. Major emergency. Drop everything and assemble. I had set it up when they had left home and both gone their individual ways. To help them in the future, I had imagined; now I was the one who was calling. They clicked off, not wasting my time or attention with needless comments. They were listening and would be here.I blasted around the last corner and stood on the brakes.Oily smoke was billowing into the air--already dying down as white spray from a fire copter played over the wrecked building. The cold clutch on my chest was physical now. I took a moment to regain control, to breathe carefully. Then ran towards the ruins. Two men in blue uniforms were in my way and both sprawled and bounced. Then there was a bigger one before me with lots of gold braid; massed minions closed ranks behind him. I got control of my adrenaline-zapped reflexes and put my brain into gear."My name is diGriz. I've reason to believe that my wife is in there ...""If you will step back and--""No." I spat the word like venom and he recoiled automatically. "I pay taxes. Lots of taxes. To pay you. I am more experienced in police operations than you are." I neglected to add on which side of the law I had gained that experience. "What do you know about this?""Nothing. Fire and police have just arrived. There was an automatic alarm call.""I'll tell you what I know. This is--or was--the Temple of Eternal Truth. A survivor just came to my house. Rowena Vinicultura. She said that my wife was here."I could hear the police computer buzzing in his earphone. "Admiral Sir James diGriz. We will do everything we can to find your wife ... Angelina. I am Captain Collin and I note that your status permits you to accompany this investigation under your own cognizance and responsibility."Purely by reflex I had established my forged bona fides as an Admiral of the Fleet when we had first come to Lussuoso. Basic precautions always pay off.We followed a large and well-insulated firefightbot into the ruins. It plowed a careful path, occasionally spraying a smoking remnant, recording for later examination every movement that it made, every obstacle it put aside. A hanging door screeched and fell and we entered the smoking interior of what had been a good-sized meeting hall. Roblights suspended fromwhirring blades floated by above us and illuminated the smoke-filled interior.Destruction on all sides--but no bodies to be seen. The cold knot was still in my midriff. The room had been seriously decorated with carved wood paneling and--now smoking--draperies. Rows of pews faced towards the destroyed side of the room where the smoke was thickest. Precipitators soon cleared the air and the floating lights glinted from wrecked and twisted machinery."We'll hold it here," Captain Collin said. "The disaster team takes over now."The disaster team was embodied in a single metallic gray robot. It was undoubtedly packed full of expert programs produced. in collaboration with fire and forensic investigators, along with detectors and probes of microscopic efficiency. Logically I knew it would do an infinitely better job than we fumbling humans: I still wanted to kick it aside and rush in."Do-you see any ... bodies?" I called out."No living creatures.

No less than Europe, Britain, or America, Australia contends with the Left, mostly Communists but also Socialists, and a rising Right, Fascists. Rowland Sinclair, bohemian younger son of the wealthy, influential, conservative clan headed by his powerful brother, Wilfred, has tangled with New South Wales' Right before. It did not go well.</p><p>New Guard leader Eric Campbell, the man who would be Australia's F�hrer, is currently in Britain "consorting with Sir Oswald Mosley," the leading British Fascist, making connections over cocktails in aid of bringing European Fascism to Australia. Campbell will soon be moving on to Germany to meet members of the Reichstag and, he hopes, Hitler.</p><p>The Australian way of life is not undefended. Old enemies have united to undermine Campbell's ambitions. Senator Charles Hardy, now a leading member of this unofficial Old Guard, brings Rowly a proposal. Their man in Munich, Peter Bothwell, who was to keep an eye on Campbell, has been killed. Rowly's mission is to investigate Bothwell's death and, while at it, do his best to derail Campbell. The Old Guard already has one Blanshard in place, serving as Campbell's interpreter, but he needs backup.</p><p>Hardy threatens to appeal to Wil to go if Rowly refuses. So he agrees. Making the trip by legs in famous airman Sir Charles Kingsford Smith's plane is a plus. Another is that his unconventional housemates, the poet (Jewish), the painter (Communist), and the sculptress (unpredictable), insist on coming along to watch his back. It's not your expected spy ring. Their cover, aside from false passports, is they are buying art. Lots of Dada art&#x2015;at the Old Guard's expense.</p><p>In Munich the friends pursue their joint missions while growing increasingly horrified at the goose-stepping euphoria, cruel acts, and book burnings of the rising Nazi movement. Yet they meet decent Germans like the tailor Alois Richter who's pursuing contracts for Nazi uniforms against rival Hugo Boss, and brave Albert G�ring, Hermann's younger brother. And two besotted women: Unity Mitford, who stakes out the Osteria Bavaria every day at eleven a.m. intent on meeting her idol Hitler; and a photographer called Eva Braun, a rather ordinary young woman who's besotted with a man she calls Mr. Wolf.</p><p>This cleverly plotted, utterly convincing story in which an amateur agent thrust into a world of spies, murderers, and despotic madmen where he can trust no one but his three mates, is the 4th in the fascinating Rowland Sinclair Mysteries.</p></p><p><p>After setting out to study astrophysics, graduating in law and then abandoning her legal career to write books, Sulari now grows French black truffles on her farm in the foothills of the Snowy Mountains of NSW.

The 1930s are a marvelous period. We know what lies ahead! This is beautifully drawn, with all its fragile hope and looming tragedy. I am delighted this is a series. I want them all." (<i><b>Anne Perry</b>, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author on <i>A Decline in Prophets</i>, Rowland Sinclair Series #2</i>)<br><br>"This installment takes the aristocratic Sinclair into a much darker place than did the previous three entries in the series but does so without losing the stylish prose and the easy way with character that have given the novels their appeal." (David Pitt <i><b><i>Booklist</i></b></i>)<br><br>"Gentill tells a good story filled with intriguing characters and is able through the setting and times as well as the events to keep the reader on edge and uncomfortable to just the right degree." (Meredith Frazier <i><b>ReviewingTheEvidence.com</b></i>)<br><br>"...stellar plot twists and her signature historical quotes throughout, deftly combining history and mystery in this page-turner." (<i><b><i>Historical Novel Society</i></b></i>)<br><br>"The combination of famous historical figures, detailed descriptions of a troubling time, and plenty of action makes for a tale as rousing as it is relevant." (<i><b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b></i>)<br><br>"While the vintage Down Under settings might make this debut, which was short-listed for the Commonwealth Writers' Prize Best First Book, comparable to Kerry Greenwood's Melbourne-based Phryne Fisher 1920s mysteries, Gentill works in historical events that add verisimilitude to her story. There are more political machinations going on here than Phryne could ever contemplate. VERDICT Thanks to Poisoned Pen Press for bringing another award-winning Australian crime writer to U.S. shores. Her witty hero will delight traditional mystery buffs." (<i><b><i>Library Journal</i></b> on <i>A Few Right Thinking Men</i>, Rowland Sinclair Series #1</i>)<br><br>"As series-launching novels go, this one is especially successful: the plot effectively plays Sinclair's aristocratic bearing and involvement in the arts against the Depression setting, fraught with radical politics, both of which he becomes involves in as he turns sleuth. And Sinclair himself is a delight: wining us over completely and making us feel as though he's an old friend." (<i><b><i>Booklist</i></b> on <i>A Few Right Thinking Men</i>, Rowland Sinclair Series #1</i>)<br><br>"... stylish, well-paced murder mystery... cheeky plotline... this tale is told with such flair and feeling for those extraordinary times... Verdict: thrilling" (<i><b><i>The Herald Sun</i></b></i>)<br><br>"Set in late 1932, Gentill's lively second mystery featuring dashing Australian millionaire Rowland "Rowly" Sinclair (after <i>A Few Right Thinking Men</i>) takes place initially aboard the luxury cruise ship Aquitania, as it steams along toward Sydney ...

(Book and CD)</h2><p>A song, based on Bible verses, which proclaims that there is a season for everything, as well as the original music by Pete Seeger, The Byrds&#39; version of the tune, and notes by Seeger about writing the song.</p><p><b>Pete Seeger</b> has been a major influence in folk music for more than fifty years, having written such songs as "If I Had a Hammer" (with Lee Hays) and "Where Have All the Flowers Gone?" Pete is also a storyteller; his children's book <i>Abiyoyo</i> is considered a classic. <i>Abiyoyo Returns,</i> which he wrote with Paul DuBois Jacobs, continues the beloved story. Pete lives with his wife, Toshi, near Beacon, New York.Grade 3-5-This rich and thoughtful book uses beautifully detailed artwork to bring new life to a familiar song. On the first page, the verse is printed on an illustration of the Earth with the repeated word "Turn!" encircling it. The focus of each of the following spreads is a large circle filled with small pictures. The verses are set along the edges, with contrasting ideas on either side ("a time to be born" on the left, "a time to die" on the right). Done in watercolor and ink, each of the round illustrations creates a cohesive whole, while its many sections tell small stories and reveal truths. The gutter divides each wheel in two, delineating between the opposing ideas of the verses. The tiny, detailed drawings fan out in all directions, forcing readers to turn the book around to view them. Some spreads are more dramatic than others: "a time of war" is illustrated with stark reds and grays, jagged lines, and images of sad children behind barbed wire and warriors in action. The illustration for "a time of peace" has rounded lines and brighter colors, and shows youngsters of all races holding hands and people enjoying quiet moments. Many details will beg for discussion, like the image of a hooded figure throwing stones at two retreating individuals. Accompanied by a CD with versions of the song by Seeger and the Byrds, this is a book for all collections.<br><i>Jane Marino, Bronxville Public Library, NY</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Millennium People: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>"The most cosmically elegiac writer in literature . . . no one reading Ballard could doubt the tidal gravity of his intellect." &#x2015;Jonathan Lethem, <em>New York Times Book Review</em></strong></p> Violent rebellion comes to London&#x2019;s middle classes in this &#x201c;fascinating&#x201d; (<em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>) novel from the same author of <em>Crash</em> and <em>Empire of the Sun</em>.

Meadow and Carrie have everything in common&#x2014;except their views on sex, power, movie-making, and morality. Their lives collide with Jelly, a loner whose most intimate experience is on the phone. Jelly is older, erotic, and mysterious. She cold calls powerful men and seduces them not through sex but through listening. She invites them to reveal themselves, and they do.<br> <br>Spiotta is &#x201c;a wonderfully gifted writer with an uncanny feel for the absurdities and sadnesses of contemporary life, and an unerring ear for how people talk and try to cope today&#x201d; (<i>The New York Times</i>). <i>Innocents and Others</i> is her greatest novel&#x2014;wise, artful, and beautiful.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of March 2016:</strong> Typically brainy and surprisingly warm, Dana Spiotta&#x2019;s <em>Innocents and Others</em> is the story of two best friends, filmmakers both, who have very different ideas about everything from movies to morality. Jelly is a third woman, more obviously messed up but probably, weirdly, as powerful in a certain world; she cold-calls important men and emotionally seduces them with her &#x201c;active listening.&#x201d; How these three women collide is the plot here. But how it is that all of our devices--technological and otherwise-- meant to help us communicate really do the opposite is the subtext. In that way--and for its clear, frank prose--<em>Innocents and Others</em> reminded me of Jennifer Egan&#x2019;s <em>Visit to the Goon Squad</em>; like that novel, this one will get under your skin. <em>--Sara Nelson</em> </p> <p><b>Guest Review by Jenny Offill</b></p> Photo Credit: Emily Tobey Photo Credit: Jessica Marx <p>"Thousands of short stories and novels have been made into movies,&#x201d; Don Delillo said once. &#x201c;I just try to reverse the process."</p> <p>But what would such a hybrid look like? Is it possible to combine the sweeping vistas of an epic film with the minute psychological detail of a realist novel? Yes, it turns out. In her brilliantly cinematic new novel, <i>Innocents and Others</i>, Dana Spiotta shows us exactly how it is done. </p> <p>On the surface, it is the story of two female filmmakers, long-time friends who share memories and a sense of ambition, but end up with very different careers. Meadow Mori makes complex, emotionally disturbing documentaries, many of which blur the line between her subjects&#x2019; active participation and their unwitting coercion. She lives the life of an experimental artist, always pushing herself to the edges of what she knows and sometimes further. Her childhood friend, Carrie Wexler, takes a less radical, more commercial route. Over the years, their friendship is strained by their aesthetic differences and they start to drift apart. </p> <p>But this is only one piece of a much larger story Spiotta is telling about love and loneliness and the search for solace and meaning in an increasingly fragmented world. She perfectly illuminates the cultural and technological obsessions of the era, bringing to the surface an uncanny mix of free-floating dread and creeping alienation that feels very modern. </p> <p>The novel also moves out beyond the lives of Meadow and Carrie and lets us into stories of two other women who live far from their privileged worlds. Meadow makes a film about Jelly, a telephone con artist who convinces Hollywood men to give her not money, but a sort of disembodied love. Later, Meadow talks Carrie into collaborating with her to make a film about another lost soul, Sarah Mills, who has been imprisoned because of a terrible crime she confessed to in her youth. There is a mystery and radiance to these crisscrossing storylines that deepens and complicates all that has come before. Neither film projects turns out as planned, but the excitement of these sections is that we get to experience the same rollercoaster of emotions that the filmmakers and their audiences do as we watch the process from idea to execution. Spiotta ingeniously uses a mix of transcripts, texts, blog posts and interviews to make Meadow and Carrie&#x2019;s struggle to make good art and ultimately to live good lives, thrillingly complicated and real. </p> <p>I came away from this bold and generous novel thinking a great deal about innocence and guilt and those small moments of redemption that allow us to live with our miscalculations and mistakes. </p>Dana Spiotta is the author of <i>Innocents and Others</i>; <i>Stone Arabia</i>, A National Books Critics Circle Award finalist; and <i>Eat the Document</i>, a finalist for the National Book Award. Spiotta is a recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and the Rome Prize for Literature.

Germany has smashed its enemies: Austria, Denmark, and France, while the United States and the Confederate States of America charge headlong into the global conflict--as bitter enemies once again. <br><br>The year is 1915, and the time of darkness has come. Though the Confederacy has defeated its northern enemy twice in fifty years, this time the United States has allied with Prussia. In the South, the freed slaves, fueled by Marxist rhetoric and the bitterness of a racist nation, take up the weapons of the Bolshevik rebellion. Despite these advantages, the United States remains pinned between Canada and the C.S.A., so the bloody conflict continues and grows. Both presidents--Theodore Roosevelt of the Union and staunch Confederate Woodrow Wilson--are stubbornly determined to lead their nations to victory, at any cost.<br><br>While land and sea battles are fought around the globe, new killing tools--poison gas, submarines, attack planes, and tanks--are pressed into service. Heroism and fear run hand in hand as ordinary men and women--families, friends, and lovers--choose desperate measures just to survive.<br><br>From the trenches that line the Canadian border to occupied Salt Lake City, The Great War: Walk in Hell takes us to the American front, then into prisoner-of-war camps, strategy meetings, and cities roiling with unrest. Once again, Harry Turtledove--"the leading author of alternate history" (USA Today)--has created a gripping, visionary portrait of how, if history had but taken another path, our world would have launched into a much bloodier War to End All Wars.</p><p>Harry Turtledove marches on through history with <i>The Great War: Walk in Hell</i>. In his alternate timeline, the Confederate States of America won the Civil War, aided by Britain and France. In the 1880s (<i>How Few Remain</i>), Americans fought again after the CSA acquired parts of Mexico--and the CSA won again. When WWI begins with Archduke Ferdinand's assassination in 1914 (<i>The Great War: American Front</i>), the 34-state USA under Teddy Roosevelt allies with Imperial Germany and Austria against Britain, France, Russia, Japan, Canada, and Woodrow Wilson's CSA. Trenches divide Canada, fierce fighting rages from Tennessee and Kentucky into Pennsylvania, a Mormon uprising against the USA consumes Utah, and a black socialist rebellion distracts the CSA, where slavery has ended but blacks still await full citizenship.<p> <i>Walk in Hell</i> takes us from fall, 1915, through 1916. Soldiers, sailors, and airmen continue the fight, but much happens behind the lines too. Turtledove's characters include Jewish immigrants who are socialist and antiwar, a widow running a coffee house in CSA-occupied Washington, D.C., who passes information to the USA, and two Canadian farmers living under U.S. occupation in Quebec and Manitoba. He vividly conveys the human side of war. When Joe Hammerschmitt gets a shoulder wound in the Virginia trenches: </p><blockquote> ... pain warred with exultation on his long, thin face. Exultation won. 'Got me a hometowner, looks like,' he said happily. Half the men up there with him made sympathetic noises; the other half looked frankly jealous. Hammerschmitt was going to be out of the firing line for weeks, maybe months, to come, and they still risked not just death but horrible mutilation every day.</blockquote><p> Some find Turtledove's cast too large, the story's action too slow. Others complain that <i>Walk in Hell</i> is too similar to his Worldwar series. Alternate history buffs, however, will marvel at his mastery of detail, enjoy following his logic as he pursues military and social developments onward in time, and find it hard to wait for the next in the series. <i>--Nona Vero</i></p><br>"Turtledove has proved he can divert his readers to astonishing places. He's developed a cult following over the years; and if you already been there, done that with real-history novelists Patrick O'Brian, Dorothy Dunnett, or George MacDonald Fraser, for your Next Big Enthusiasm you might want to try Turtledove. I know I'd follow his imagination almost anywhere."<br>--San Jose Mercury News</p><h2>Ukraine</h2><p>The events of February 2014 need to be seen against the whole sad history of Ukraine. This vast fertile country on the north shore of the Black Sea, with no geographic features to defend itself against centuries of assaults from Asia, Cossacks, Poles, and both Imperial and Soviet Russians. These all in turn sought to impose their political and economic structures by ruthless violence. People over the centuries were persecuted, expelled, and massacred. Nevertheless 150 years ago a Ukrainian consciousness, a distinct culture and a language differing from Russian emerged but at the same time industry rapidly expanded, needing a Russian workforce. The privileges and corruption of successive ruling elites corroded the whole of society. Flag independence in 1991 aroused questions of national identity. Post Soviet Russia returned to the view of a historic right to intervene as in the days of Peter and Catherine the Great, Lenin and Stalin; in a territory seen as &#x201c;the near abroad&#x201d; by President Putin.</p><p></p><h2>Bernard Claytons Complete Book of Small Breads: More Than 100 Recipes for Rolls Buns Biscuits Flatbreads Muffins and Other</h2><p>A master baker demonstrates his easy-to-follow style for amateur and professionals alike in this collection of more than one hundred global recipes that includes Czech kolaches, Chinese steamed buns, Indiana corn muffins, Syrian sumsums, and English hedgehog rolls. 30,000 first printing. Tour.</p><p>Bernard Clayton has six very solid cookbooks to his credit, starting with <i>The Complete Book of Breads</i>, first published in the 1970s. Somehow it seems only fitting that he would wind his way, by book number seven, back to a big book about little breads. Does it fit in your palm? This appears to be the primary criterion for the breads in <i>The Complete Book of Small Breads</i>. There are beaten biscuits from the American South and steamed buns from China, <i>pan dulce</i> from Mexico and oatmeal flatbread from Norway, orange tiffin rolls from India and spice corn fritters from Indonesia--more than 100 recipes in all.<p> Some of the recipes will seem familiar to anyone who has used other Clayton cookbooks, for he has culled from his own greatest hits to fill this book. But he has downsized the recipes: "The book will appeal to those home bakers with small families or those with limited kitchen facilities," he writes. "The yield of most of the recipes is small, reduced to about half the quantity found in others."</p><p> Those new to baking and experienced bakers alike will enjoy Clayton's clear instructions. He takes into account bakers doing everything by hand as well as those who use mixers or food processors. Once you've become accustomed to the way Clayton lays out a recipe, you'll wonder what's wrong with every other cookbook author in the business.</p><p> But most of all, there's Clayton's easygoing attitude to spur you on to even more delicious discoveries. "I urge the home baker to see baking as a relaxed art," Clayton writes. "In bread making, if the dough you are shaping gets stubborn, pulls back, and refuses to be shaped, walk away from it for a few minutes. It will relax and so will you." <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i></p></p><h2>Swamp Thing VOL 05: Earth to Earth</h2><p>As the Swamp Thing continues his quest for enlightenment with the aid of mystic John Constantine, he comes across an omen of destruction, prompting him to call to his aid allies including Deadman and the Spectre.</p><p>Alan Moore is one of the most respected and admired writers in comics today.

But new products and equipment revolutionized the kitchen, and these changes inspired <i>Bernard Clayton's New Complete Book of Breads,</i> which first appeared in 1987. With an electric mixer, a food processor, or a bread machine, and with faster-acting yeasts, anyone could produce home-baked loaves in a fraction of the time bread-baking once took. The availability of a wide variety of flours and specialty products, once found only in health-food and gourmet stores, opened up a world of possibilities. Clayton revised 200 of the original recipes and added 100 more with these new ingredients and equipment in mind. <p>Now America's best-loved bread-baking authority returns with the 30th anniversary edition of the <i>New Complete Book of Breads,</i> the definitive version of this baking classic. Clayton has written a new introduction, added a glossary, updated the sections on ingredients and equipment, and gone through every recipe, correcting and refining each one. The inviting new design keeps Clayton's explicit, easy-to-follow instructional format and makes the book easy to use.</p><p>In these pages, home bakers will find an extraordinary range of variety, nearly enough to supply a new bread a day for a year. There are wheat breads -- Honey-Lemon, Walnut, Buttermilk; sourdough breads; corn breads; breads flavored with herbs or spices or enriched with cheese or fruits and nuts; and little breads -- Kaiser Rolls, Grandmother's Southern Biscuits, English Muffins, and Popovers, to name a few. For the baker who observes the holidays with a fresh loaf there are Challah and Italian Panettone.</p><p>Offering classic recipes while making use of modern kitchen technology, this comprehensive volume is an indispensable reference for the novice or experienced home baker looking to make the best bread with ease.</p></p><p>In the 1970s, Bernard Clayton's <i>The Complete Book of Breads</i> became the bible for bread bakers everywhere. In the years since its publication, however, new equipment such as dough-mixing attachments and food processors, and new products such as fast-acting yeast and specialty bread flour, have revolutionized the kitchen. A new era requires a new book, and Bernard Clayton has obliged with his <i>New Complete Book of Breads</i>. Here you'll find 200 of Clayton's original recipes from his earlier book, all revised with modern equipment and products in mind. In addition, Clayton includes 100 new recipes gathered during the course of his research and travels as well as his interactions with friends and readers. Whether you're hungry for breads, rolls, muffins, popovers, seasonal favorites, or exotic delights destined to become favorites, you'll find them all in the <i>New Complete Book of Breads</i>.Award-winning author <i>Bernard Clayton Jr.</i> began his career as a reporter and foreign correspondent; baking and cooking were his hobbies. He has been writing cookbooks for more than thirty years. When Mr. Clayton travels, he investigates historical and regional recipes, conversing with cooks and bakers around the world.

An active conservationist, she lives in the lowcountry of South Carolina where she is at work on her next novel. Visit her at maryalicemonroe.com and on Facebook.<br><br>Cara had begun this long journey home many times in her mind over the years, but always there was some project, some appointment, some emotional obstacle of her own construction that stopped her.<br><br>Road weary and life tired, Cara was traveling the path of least resistance as she headed south across the flat expanse of the old cotton country known as the coastal plains. It had been over twenty years since she'd driven this long stretch of South Carolina highway toward the sea. Growing up, she'd always considered it someplace to drive through on her way to somewhere else. Anywhere else.<br><br>She passed vanishing woodlands and acres of farmland for sale, huge, flat-roofed warehouses and sun-faded billboards heralding exits for boiled peanuts, tree-ripened peaches, stock-car racing and fireworks. It was late May. Spring was already giving way to sizzling summer in the South. Elderberry bushes rambled along the roadsides, and beyond in the pinewoods, Cara knew the coral beans were aflame and swamp roses decorated the banks like some wild hothouse garden.<br><br>The thought that the sea turtles were returning home to nest sprang to mind. She laughed out loud at the irony.<br><br>If someone had told her a year ago that the following May she would be driving to Charleston for an extended visit with her mother, Cara would have tossed back her head and laughed in that throaty manner of hers. "Impossible," she would have told them, the smile slipping from her face and a flash sparking in her eyes. First of all, her schedule would never have allowed it. Every minute of her day was double booked. At best, in an emergency, she might fly in for an overnight stop, as she had for her father's funeral. Secondly, there was nowhere on earth she'd least want to visit than Charleston. And no person less than her mother. The current status of a polite truce had worked well for them both over the past years of her self-imposed exile.<br><br>But, as always, Mama's timing was impeccable. Where else would one go but home when there was nowhere else to go?<br><br>Cara tightened her grip on the steering wheel. How could her orderly life have careened so far out of control? How did it happen that, after twenty-two years of living independently, after a successful career, after complete and utter self-sufficiency, she found herself back on this damnable stretch of road limping back home?<br><br>It was her mother's letter that had lured her. The day before, Lovie had sent the customary flowers for Cara's birthday. As Cara gingerly unwrapped the purple florist tissue, the heady scent of the gardenias permeated her apartment.<br><br>Instantly, Cara was back in her mother's walled garden in Charleston where an ancient magnolia spread its broad glossy leaves and the white, heavily scented flowers of the gardenias competed with the climbing jasmine. She'd opened the letter from her mother and read her familiar, feathery script.<br><br><em>Happy Birthday Dear Caretta!<br><br>I never smell gardenias without thinking of you.<br><br>Things have been in a state of flux since your father's death. Now it is time for me to, shall we say, put my house in order. Come home, Cara, just for a while. Not to the house on Tradd Street. Come to the beach house. We've always had the best times there, haven't we?<br><br>Please don't say that you are too busy or that you can't get away. Remember how we used to say "Take charge of your birthday"? Can't you grant yourself this one gift of time and spend a few days with your ancient mother? Please come home, Cara dear. Soon. Your father is gone and we need to sort through years of accumulation.<br><br>Love, Mama</em><br><br>Perhaps it was the scent of the gardenias that prompted the sudden loneliness, or simply that someone had remembered her birthday. Or perhaps it was her desolation at having just lost her job. But for the first time since leaving her embrace at eighteen, Cara felt a sudden, desperate longing for her mother.<br><br>She wanted to go home. Home to the Lowcountry, where once she had been happy.<br><br>Cara crossed the Ashley and the Wando rivers, took a final turn off the highway, then sped over a new, graceful arch of roadway that connected the mainland to the small barrier island called Isle of Palms. The vista yawned open before her, revealing a breathtaking view of endless blue sky and watery, greening marsh stretched out as far as she could see. She felt her mind ease as she took in the wide-open space. The hustle and honking of the crowded roads felt a world behind her. Ahead, cutting a wide, blue path through the waving grasses, was the sparkling Intracoastal Waterway and parallel to it, the smaller Hamlin Creek lined with docks, one after another, most with a boat at moor. She reached the peak of the arch.<br><br>Suddenly, looming straight ahead, like a magnificent yet serene beast, lay the vast, glistening expanse of blue that was the Atlantic Ocean. It was a living thing, pulsating power beneath the quiescent surface. Her breath caught, her body shivered and in that soul-striking instant, Cara knew that saltwater still ran thick in her veins.<br><br>She was back on the Isle of Palms. Even the name was soft on the tongue and evoked images of waving palm trees and tranquil, sunny afternoons by the rolling surf. For a hundred years, the Isle of Palms was a place the folks of Charleston and Columbia escaped to when the summers got too beastly hot. They took the ferryboat over to camp in the pine and oak forests or dance at the pavilion to big-name bands. Years later, bridges and roads were built and each summer the island's population swelled along with the heat. Growing up, Cara had spent summer after summer here with her mother and her older brother, Palmer. Her happiest memories were of the three of them living without paying mind to a clock, letting the sultry light of the Carolina sun dictate their days.<br><br>She'd heard that back in 1989 Hurricane Hugo had turned the island upside down. But she hadn't imagined the extent that time could alter a landscape. This used to be a sleepy island town with a grocer, liquor and hardware store clustered together beside a small stretch of postcardish, islandy restaurants. Ocean Boulevard was but a line of modest beach cottages across from a wide stretch of sand dunes that rolled lazily along the ocean.<br><br>So it was all the more shocking to see that the dunes she'd played on were gone, paved flat for a row of mansions that formed a wall of pastel-colored wood blocking the view of the sea and dwarfing the once oceanfront cottages across the street. These beautiful new post-Hugo houses stood even closer to the water's edge, as though arrogantly daring the heavens to strike again. Cara could turn her head left, then right as she drove and see, in turn, an eerie picture of pre-and post-Hugo worlds.<br><br>Still, some things never changed, she thought as she spied a line of pelicans flying overhead looking like a squadron of bombardiers on patrol. She opened her window to the balmy island air and breathed deeply. Dusk was setting in, and with each moist breeze she felt a page of her history flutter back, recalling the days when she was young and pedaled this road on her bicycle, feeling the wind toss her hair like streamers behind her. She drove another two blocks south, scanning. Her breath caught in her throat when she saw it.<br><br>Primrose Cottage. As pale a yellow as the delicate evening primroses that surrounded it, the 1930s beach cottage sat back from the road perched on a small dune. In contrast to all the meticulously landscaped properties of the newer mansions, her mother's house appeared as a wispy memory of the past glowing in the twilight among waves of tall grasses, brilliant pink phlox and yellow primroses for which it had been named. Although a bit wind worn, the old frame house with the low spreading roof and the wide, welcoming verandas seemed as indigenous here as the palmetto trees.<br><br>It had been twenty years since she'd laid eyes on this house. So many years since embarking on the journey from little girl to middle-aged woman. Pulling up to the curb to stare, it occurred to her that while she'd been busy with her life in Chicago, oblivious to the goings-on of the island, this charming little house was here, patiently waiting for her.<br><br>She shifted into gear and slowly drove around the block to the back of the house, pulling into the winding gravel driveway, careful when the wheels dug past the thin layer of gravel to hit sand. She released a short laugh to see the old, shiny gold VW convertible parked beneath the porch. Mama was still driving The Gold Bug? That old ragtop was like a flag. Everyone knew if The Gold Bug was in the driveway, Olivia Rutledge was in residence and ready for visitors.<br><br>Coming to a stop, Cara could feel the miles still moving in her veins. She stared out the windshield at what had always been home and wondered if <em>she</em> was now a visitor at Primrose Cottage, too. Did blood alone earn her the right to call it home? Did hours of pulling weeds from the flower beds and boarding up windows against storms, or years of swinging on the front porch count for anything? She sighed and pulled up the parking brake. Probably not. Besides, she remembered how, in a fit of youthful passion, she'd made a point of shouting to her mother that she wanted nothing at all to do with her, her damn father or anything connected to them.<br><br>Yet the connection tugged, pulling her out from the stale confines of the car into the cool offshore breezes spiked with the heady scent of honeysuckle. She stood, one foot on the sand, the other perched on the car, feeling the undertow sweep her back, back from the shoreline of the world she'd left behind.<br><br>Her memories were crowding her now and she anxiously eyed the remaining feet to her mother's door. She wanted to go in but years of anger rooted her to the spot. So she leaned against the car, formulating what she would say that could break the ice yet still allow her to keep a modicum of self-respect. She'd stay one week, she told herself, gathering courage. Maybe ten days. Any more than that and her mother would drive her crazy and they'd fall back into that pattern of bickering and harsh words followed by long, sulking silences. Oh, God, she thought, rubbing her forehead. Was it a mistake to come back at all?<br><br>All around her the sky darkened to dusky purples and blues and the birds called out their final warnings to go home. A dog howled somewhere in the distance. Then, from around the house, she heard the high melodic hum of a woman's voice.<br><br>Cara moved to peek around the corner. Ambling up the sandy ocean path she saw a diminutive woman in a big, floppy straw hat, a long, faded denim skirt and bright red Keds. Bits of the tune she was humming carried in the breeze, nothing recognizable. In one arm she lugged a red plastic bucket, a telltale sign of one of the island's Turtle Ladies. Cara's heart beat wildly but she remained silent, watching. From this distance she might have mistaken the woman for a young girl. She seemed utterly carefree and oblivious to anything save for the field of wildflowers she passed. She paused en route to stoop and snip a flower, then, resuming her hum, she continued up the path toward Primrose Cottage.<br><br>A million things that Cara had meant to say, a thousand postures she'd meant to strike, evaporated as quickly as sea foam once it hits the shore.<br><br>"Mama!" she called out.<br><br>Her mother stopped short and swung her head in her direction. Bright blue eyes sparkled from under the broad rim of the hat and her mouth opened in a gasp of genuine pleasure. Dropping her bucket, she held out her arms in a joyous welcome. "Caretta!"<br><br>Cara cringed at hearing the name she despised, but closed the distance quickly, following the age-old path of a child to her mother's embrace. Taller by a head, she bent her knees and felt like she always did beside Olivia Rutledge&#x2014;like a clambering bull next to a porcelain doll. Yet when her mother's arms flung around her and squeezed tightly, Cara felt a sweeping flush of childlike pleasure.<br><br>"I've missed you," her mother said softly against her cheek. "You're home again. At last."<br><br>Cara squeezed back but too many years of silence choked all words. She released her hold and, stepping back, it struck her like a fist's blow how much her mother had changed. Olivia Rutledge had become an old woman. Beneath the cheery straw hat her skin was pale and seemed to hang from her prominent cheekbones. The brightness of her blue eyes had dimmed, and though always small and trim, she was now painfully thin.<br><br>How could it have happened so quickly, Cara wondered? Only eighteen months ago at her father's funeral Olivia still retained that timeless quality to her beauty and grace. At sixty-nine she wasn't young, of course, but Cara couldn't think of her mother as <em>old.</em> She was one of those lucky women born with a girlish, slender body and a face that was as scrubbed fresh and naturally pretty as the wildflowers she adored. Her father used to say that he married Olivia because she was as sweet as she looked&#x2014;and it was true. Everyone loved Olivia Rutledge, "Lovie" to those who knew her well.<br><br>But her daughter knew the price that ready smile had cost her mother over the years.<br><br></p><h2>Autumn at Notforgotten Farm: Needlework Projects to Warm Your Hands and Heart</h2><p>The comfort of handwork awaits you &#x2013; the rhythm of pulling wool loops through linen, a flash of needle and the tug of thread.

Recently one sold for over five million dollars. It is the book that rescued the name of William Shakespeare and half of his plays from oblivion. <i>The Millionaire and the Bard</i> tells the miraculous and romantic story of the making of the First Folio, and of the American industrialist whose thrilling pursuit of the book became a lifelong obsession.<br><br>When Shakespeare died in 1616 half of his plays died with him. No one&#x2014;not even their author&#x2014;believed that his writings would last, that he was a genius, or that future generations would celebrate him as the greatest author in the history of the English language. By the time of his death his plays were rarely performed, eighteen of them had never been published, and the rest existed only in bastardized forms that did not stay true to his original language.<br> <br>Seven years later, in 1623, Shakespeare&#x2019;s business partners, companions, and fellow actors, John Heminges and Henry Condell, gathered copies of the plays and manuscripts, edited and published thirty-six of them. This massive book, the First Folio, was intended as a memorial to their deceased friend. They could not have known that it would become one of the most important books ever published in the English language, nor that it would become a fetish object for collectors. <br> <br><i>The Millionaire and the Bard</i> is a literary detective story, the tale of two mysterious men&#x2014;a brilliant author and his obsessive collector&#x2014;separated by space and time. It is a tale of two cities&#x2014;Elizabethan and Jacobean London and Gilded Age New York. It is a chronicle of two worlds&#x2014;of art and commerce&#x2014;that unfolded an ocean and three centuries apart. And it is the thrilling tale of the luminous book that saved the name of William Shakespeare &#x201c;to the last syllable of recorded time.&#x201d;</p><p>Andrea E. Mays has degrees in economics from the State University of New York at Binghamton and from UCLA, and teaches economics at California State University at Long Beach. Like Henry Folger, she is a native New Yorker and has had a lifelong Shakespeare obsession. She spent much of her Manhattan girlhood in the New York Public Library listening to vinyl LP recordings of performances by the Royal Shakespeare Company. <i>The Millionaire and the Bard</i> is her first book.The Millionaire and the Bard Prologue<p></p> <br><br> &#x201c;He was Not of an Age, but for All Time!&#x201d;<p></p> <br>&#x2014;BEN JONSON<br> <br>IT STARTED, as many great obsessions do, with an unremarkable incident, an encounter between a man and a book. It happened during the Gilded Age, in New York City. Henry Clay Folger was a recent graduate of Columbia Law School living in rented rooms, working as a clerk at a local oil refinery, and trying to make his way in the world.<br> <br>He walked into Bang&#x2019;s auction gallery in Manhattan with, as he later admitted, &#x201c;fear and trepidation.&#x201d;1 The books to be sold that day overflowed from the shelves. As an undergraduate at Amherst College he had studied literature, including Shakespeare, whose plays he &#x201c;read&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. far into the night.&#x201d;2 He had continued reading for pleasure ever since. He saved every book he ever read. He had always been a collector. At college, he made scrapbooks for his most trivial ephemera, including theater and lecture tickets. But his hoarder&#x2019;s impulse was still in search of a grand obsession.<br> <br>Henry had never bought a rare book. The closest he had ever come was when he purchased a gift for his young wife. She shared his literary enthusiasm, so he had bought her an inexpensive facsimile of the First Folio of the collected plays of William Shakespeare. He had never seen a real one. The old book that caught his eye at Bang&#x2019;s was not, however, a coveted First Folio published in 1623, but to his amateur&#x2019;s eye it seemed close. It was an authentic Fourth Folio, printed in 1685; it was a less valuable edition than a First. Its antiquity excited his fancy. He bid on the book until the auctioneer hammered it down to him for $107.50. He asked if he could pay in installments. When he took it home, he and his wife gazed at the familiar engraving of Shakespeare on the title page. They turned the thick, durable rag paper pages, and savored the familiar words of the plays they both loved, and which they had read many times before in cheap, modern editions. Holding that old book in his hands changed Henry Folger&#x2019;s life, just as the publication of its first edition more than two hundred fifty years earlier had come to define its author&#x2019;s.<br> <br>Soon, Folger found himself in the thrall of obsession. The young man who could barely afford a hundred-dollar book would spend a year&#x2019;s salary for another one, and devote the rest of his life, and millions of dollars, to chasing the rare books he coveted. The apprentice clerk would rise in the world of Gilded Age titans&#x2014;John D. Rockefeller, J. P. Morgan, Henry Huntington&#x2014;and join them in a frenzied competition for some of the rarest books in the world. Soon, he would own more volumes than he knew what to do with. They would overwhelm his shelves, his rented rooms, and then his home, and fill secret warehouses and storage lockers to their ceilings. Before long, Henry Folger&#x2019;s books would dominate his life. But in this ocean of books he prized one above all the others.<br> <br>Today, it is the most valuable book in the world. And, after the King James Bible, the most important. In October 2001, one of the First Folios sold at Christie&#x2019;s for more than six million dollars. No more than 750 copies were printed, and two-thirds of them have perished over the last 391 years. Around 244 of them survive, and most of those are incomplete. Shakespeare&#x2019;s First Folio&#x2014;Folger wanted to own them all.<br> <br>As Victor Hugo wrote, &#x201c;England has two books, one of which she has made, the other which has made her&#x2014;Shakespeare and the Bible.&#x201d; Published in London in 1623, Mr. William Shakespeares Comedies, Histories, &amp; Tragedies revolutionized the language, psychology, and culture of Western civilization. Without the First Folio, published seven years after the playwright&#x2019;s death, eighteen iconic works, including Macbeth, Measure for Measure, Julius Caesar, Antony and Cleopatra, Twelfth Night, The Winter&#x2019;s Tale, and The Tempest would have been lost.<br> <br>Recognizing that every folio was superficially the same book but that each surviving handmade copy was in fact unique with its own idiosyncratic typographical fingerprint, binding, and provenance, Folger decided that the only way to rediscover Shakespeare&#x2019;s original intentions and language&#x2014;what he called &#x201c;The True Text&#x201d;&#x2014;was to buy every copy he could find and subject it to meticulous comparative analysis.<br> <br>Believing that the mysteries of the folios could be fully understood only in the context of their time, he amassed an equally stupendous collection of artwork, books, letters, manuscripts, and antiquities from sixteenth- and seventeenth-century England. He wanted to own Shakespeare. And he did. He came to own more copies of the First Folio than anyone else in the world, more than even the British Library, the ultra-repository in Shakespeare&#x2019;s homeland. Folger collected more than twice the number of copies known to exist in all of England. How this happened is more than the tale of one passionate bibliophile. It is a story of the Old World giving way to the New, of the power of modern economics and transatlantic trade, and of the irresistible democratization of taste.<br> <br>Everyone knows William Shakespeare. He was born in 1564, and died in April 1616. He wrote approximately thirty-nine plays3 and composed five long poems and 154 sonnets. He failed to publish his collected works&#x2014;during his lifetime plays were considered ephemeral amusements, not serious literature. By the time of his death he was retired, was considered past his prime, and by the 1620s many of his plays were no longer regularly performed in theaters. No one&#x2014;not even Shakespeare himself&#x2014;believed that his writings would last, that he was a genius, or that future generations would celebrate him as the greatest and most influential writer in the history of the English language.<br> <br>Harold Bloom has argued that Shakespeare transformed the nature of man and created modern consciousness. If that is so, then the First Folio&#x2014;not the works of Darwin, Marx, or Freud&#x2014;is the urtext of modernism. If the Bible is the book of God, then Shakespeare is the book of man on earth. We use the words he invented, we speak in his cadences, and we think in his imagery. The epitaph that fellow poet Ben Jonson penned for William Shakespeare proved to be prophetic: &#x201c;He was not of an age, but for all time!&#x201d; Without the First Folio, the evolution from poet to secular saint would have never happened, and the story of that book is an incredible tale of faith, friendship, loyalty, and chance. Today, few people realize how close the world came, in the aftermath of Shakespeare&#x2019;s death, to losing half of his plays.<br> <br>Henry Clay Folger, however, remains one of the least-known industrial titans of his time. Folger, from the twilight years of the Gilded Age through the comet&#x2019;s arc of the Roaring Twenties, built the greatest Shakespeare library in the world, transporting it across the Atlantic piece by piece and hoarding it in thousands of unopened shipping crates, locked away in secret New York warehouses. And yet his life remains curiously unexamined. He is a forgotten man.<br> <br>This is a story of resurrection, of a magical book and two men, an American millionaire and an English playwright&#x2014;the man who coveted the First Folio, and the man who composed it.<br> <br></p><h2>Richard Scarry&#39;s Great Big Schoolhouse</h2><p><i>Great Big Schoolhouse</i> is lovingly remembered by generations of American children whose first day at school was undoubtedly made easier by Scarry&#x2019;s warm, friendly, and comforting classroom.

Which poison recently laced the food of Russian ex-KGB agent Viktor Litvinenko, and how did it kill him? In Death in the Pot, internationally renowned food expert Morton Satin documents several culinary mishaps and misdeeds in an engrossing narrative that spans the ancient world to the present day.Historic events both tragic and bizarre have resulted from adulterated food. In the fifth century BCE, the great plague of Athens, probably caused by contaminated cereals, led to the defeat of the Athenians in the Peloponnesian War. In the prescientific Middle Ages, illnesses resulting from contaminated food were often attributed to the wrath of God or malevolent spirits. Heavily infectious ergot induced a spasmodic muscle condition, which the Church named &#34;St. Anthony&#39;s Fire&#34; and interpreted as retribution by God on heretics. Similarly, in seventeenth-century America the hallucinogenic symptoms of moldy grain were thought by Puritans to be signs of witchcraft. Even the madness of King George III, which played a role in the American Revolution, may have been induced by accidental arsenic poisoning.In the twentieth century, Satin recounts the efforts of modern industrial societies to make food safer; in some cases these efforts were heroic. For example, in the early days of the Food and Drug Administration a &#34;Poison Squad&#34; was formed, consisting of young scientists who willingly acted as guinea pigs to test the toxic effects of chemical additives. Today, the government has focused on the hazards of food bioterrorism. Satin concludes by describing measures taken to protect the public from intentional and unintentional poisoning, as well as recounting recent poisoning incidents.Both a fascinating glimpse into history from a unique angle and an authoritative reference work on food safety, Death in the Pot offers entertaining and informative reading for laypersons as well as experts in food technology and public health.</p><p>Morton Satin is currently the director of technical and regulatory affairs at the Salt Institute. He recently retired as the director of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization&#x2019;s Global Agribusiness Program. A molecular biologist, he is the author of Death in the Pot: The Impact of Food Poisoning on History and Coffee Talk: The Stimulating Story of the World's Most Popular Brew.In this unexpectedly timely account, Satin makes a case for how food poisoning has affected human events over time, although he acknowledges that there's not much scientific evidence for his theories. Still, his speculations are fascinating. Satin, a molecular biologist who has worked for many years in the food industry (<i>Food Alert! The Ultimate Sourcebook for Food Safety</i>), relates dramatic examples of possibly toxic food and drink. He considers various theories to explain what he says is a case of mass food poisoning in the Bible, when the Israelites in the desert died after eating quail. The epidemic of lead poisoning during the Roman Empire was due to the preparation of wine in lead-lined containers and, according to the author, contributed to Rome's downfall. Leapfrogging through time, Satin describes how Westerners living in Hong Kong were deliberately poisoned with arsenic in their bread during the Second Opium War in 1857. Of particular interest is a lengthy overview of the evolution of food and beverage standards in the U.S.; first established in the late 19th century, the rules stopped the practice of harmful adulteration by unscrupulous manufacturers. He also deals with the recent outbreaks of <i>E. coli</i> and the possibility of bioterrorism. Though the account rambles, many of the details are quite arresting.

Tour.</p><p>Tomato clafoutis, herb-cured filet of beef Carpaccio, garlic family soup, Catalan tuna daube: these and 171 other recipes pour off the pages of this sumptuous coffee-table cookbook by the author of <i>Bistro Cooking</i> and <i>Simply French</i>. Wells concentrates on coaxing the utmost flavor out of simple, fresh food, and her French recipes are not all swimming in cream, oils, and fats: the filet, for example, profits not from a heavy sauce but from being wrapped for two days in tarragon, parsley, basil, thyme, and salt. In a couple of places Wells even commits the heresy, for a French-style chef, of switching a red wine used to simmer meat to a white wine.For the past thirteen years, Patricia Wells has been carrying on a love affair-not with an individual, but with a region of France, a centuries-old stone farmhouse, and a cuisine. Now, in a cookbook that captures the soul of modern regional French cooking, the award-winning journalist and author invites readers to share the passion, the joy, and, best of all, the cooking of her adopted home. <p> Provence is uniquely blessed with natural beauty as well as some of the world's most appealing foods and liveliest wines. Patricia's culinary skills have transformed the signature ingredients of this quintessential French countryside into recipes so satisfying and exciting they will instantly become part of your daily repertoire. </p><p> Here are 175 recipes from Patricia's farmhouse kitchen. Simple but imaginative "palate openers" such as Tuna Tapenade are followed by a profusion of salads, from All-Star Herb Salad, which captures the essence of the herb garden in a single bite, to the vibrant, cream-dressed greens of the Cheesemaker's Salad. </p><p> Vegetables have a special place in the hearts and palates of Provence's cooks, so Patricia presents an entire chapter of quick-and-easy vegetable creations. From the crunch and herbal freshness of Fresh Beans with Garlic &amp; Herbs to the elegant simplicity of Potatoes Roasted in Sea Salt, these are recipes for the vegetarian and nonvegetarian alike. </p><p> Soul-satisfying soups have their own chapter, with such delights as Summer Piston and the deeply flavorfull Caramelized Fennel Soup. This chapter is highlighted by Monkfish Bouillabaisse with Aioli, Patricia's own brilliant interpretation of a Provencal classic. Pastas, too, are on the menu, with inventive dishes like Provencal Penne and Spaghetti with Green Olive Puttanesca, inspired by the produce of Patricids village market. A chapter on breads includes everything from Crusty Wheat &amp; Polenta Bread to an olive oil brioche, a local classic. </p><p> Poultry and game are represented with everything from Butter-Roasted Herbed Chicken to Monsieur Hennys Rabbit Bouillabaisse. In the fish and shellfish department, you will savor Seared Pancetta-Wrapped Cod and The Valson Fishmonger's Fresh Tuna Casserole. When it comes to meat, Patricia offers recipes for earthy <i>daubes</i>, the slow-simmered almost-stews so beloved by the French, along with homey favorites like Lemon-Thyme Lamb Chops, and Spit-Roasted Brine-Cured Pork. </p><p> To round out the meal, there is a treasure trove of desserts based on seasonal fruits-Cherry-Almond Tart, Winernaker's Grape Cake, and Patricids Apricot-Honey-Almond Tart, as effortless as child's play but as impressive as the most exacting work of the pastrymaker's art. </p><p> As you read and cook from this book, generously illustrated with the captivating color pictures of famed photographer Robert Freson, you will feel as if you have actually joined Patricia Wells in her beloved stone farmhouse, and her passion for the foods, flavors, and people of Provence will become yours. As comforting as an old friend, as enlivening as a trip to the sun-dappled hills of southern France, this book will truly bring Provence into your kitchen, and you will want to visit its pages again and again.</p></p><h2>The Psyche As Sacrament: A Comparative Study of C.G. Jung and Paul Tillich</h2><p>In the Western world, psychology and religion are not easy companions This extraordinary comparative study illustrates with great clarity that the antagonism is unnecessary. C. G. Jung the psychiatrist (1875-1961) and Paul Tillich the theologian (1886-1965) both understand God as immediately present, an inner reality and an inner reality and an inner resource. Tillich points to God as a power in life that transcends the ego, urging man on to wholeness - a power Jung calls the Self: the regulating center of the personality. Tillich speaks of self-acceptance. Jung of relating to one&#39;s complexes. Tillich writes of the journey toward essential humanity. Jung of the process of individuation. With a perspective that embraces both camps, the author examines the deeper meaning for Christian and non-Christian alike of God, Christ, the Spirit, the Trinity, morality and the religious life. In the depths of the soul, he concludes the psychological task and the religious task are one</p><p></p><h2>Primitive Christianity Revived (MSF Early Quaker Series)</h2><p>This book is a combination of two separate publications by William Penn, one being his book Primitive Christianity Revived (first published in 1696), and the other, A Brief Account of the Rise and Progress of the People Called Quakers, which originally served as the introduction to the Journal of George Fox (published in 1694) but was later printed separately. The two publications overlapped in their scope, both dealing (in various degrees) with the rise of the Society of Friends, and the distinct principles and practices of this people, and it was thought that these short books could be combined and interwoven in such a way as to present the reader with a more thorough presentation of these subjects than either publication could do individually. In attempting to do this, I have taken a degree of editorial liberty&#x2014;removing repetition, adding short segues between sections, and moving paragraphs around to where they seemed to fit best. I have also attempted to carefully and conscientiously modernize and sometimes re-word Penn&#x2019;s archaic (albeit beautiful) language, adding an occasional Scripture reference or a phrase of my own with the aim of greater clarity. My objective was not simply to republish the works of William Penn; all of his original publications still exist and are available through many online sources. My goal was to present the present-day seeker of truth with a readable and heart-impacting account of what God did in the early Society of Friends, which is the same that He desires to do in the hearts and lives of every modern Christian.</p><p></p><h2>Hitler and His Generals: Military Conferences 1942-1945</h2><p><br>The military conferences that Hitler had twice daily with his staff, where he directed the war, were transcribed by stenographers from 1942 to 1945 in the bunker. These authentic documents are the only record kept by the Germans of their highest military decisions at the critical moment when the war turned against them.</p><p>Helmut Heiber is a contemporary historian working for the Institute for Contemporary History in Munich, where he lives.In 1942, as Germany's military fortunes began to wane, an angry Hitler, frustrated with his generals, ordered a transcript made of his regular military conferences so that there would be no confusion as to his orders. Despite the widespread destruction of many of the documents in 1945, some of the transcripts survived, portions of which have been published over the past 50 years. Containing all of the extant material, these volumes challenge both the postwar memoirs of the generals, who often describe Hitler as the chief impediment to military success, and Hitler's apologists, who blame conservative generals for the Wehrmacht's failures. Reading the transcripts presented here reinforces the opinion of a growing number of historians that it was Hitler's policies, along with the actions of his generals, that led to Germany's defeat. These volumes, which represent the first translation into English of the surviving transcripts, will be of interest to military historians, as well as those who study how decisions were made in Nazi Germany. World War II enthusiasts will enjoy following the actions of Germany's military machine during the last three years of the war. A concise introduction by Gerhard Weinberg (history, Univ. of North Carolina, Chapel Hill) complements Heiber's explanation of the transcripts and their reconstruction.

If I were also a philologist, or scholar, or archeologist, I might be able to provide some explanation. But I am only his faithful famulus amanuensis, and the instructions he left me were clear and explicit: &#34;Two years after my death, you shall publish Book Four of The Essene Gospel of Peace.&#34; That was all, and I am now carrying out that wish. This book Four, The Teachings of the Elect, represents yet another fragment of the complete manuscript which exists in Aramaic in the Secret Archives of the Vatican and in old Slavonic in the Royal Library of the Habsburgs (now the property of the Austrian government). As to the reason for the delay in its publication, I can only surmise that Dr. Szekely wanted the vivid reality of these ageless truths to stand alone, obscured even by the presence of the translator. He did say in his Preface to the first London edition of Book One in 1937 that &#34; we have issued this part before the rest because it is the part of which suffering humanity has most need today.&#34; Perhaps, in the same way, the troubled world of forty-four years later needs this fourth volume of The Essene Gospel of Peace. --- excerpt from book&#39;s Preface by Norma Nilsson Bordeaux</p><p></p><h2>Pyramid: And Four Other Kurt Wallander Mysteries</h2><p>A volume of short works featuring the popular investigator features Wallander as a young patrolman on his first case, a new father facing unexpected danger on Christmas Eve, a middle-aged man solving a poisoning death, a separated husband investigating a photographer&#39;s murder, and a veteran detective connecting a dual murder to a plane crash. 50,000 first printing.</p><p><strong>Henning Mankell</strong> is Sweden&#x2019;s single most-read author around the world. His novels, which include the bestselling Kurt Wallander mysteries, have been translated into thirty-seven languages with more than 30 million copies in print worldwide. He has received the German Tolerance Prize and the Macallan Golden Dagger and has been a three-time finalist for the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> Mystery/Thriller Book Prize. Born in Stockholm in 1948 and raised in a village in northern Sweden, Mankell divides his time between Sweden and Maputo, Mozambique, where he works as the director of Teatro Avenida.<br>Once again, Dick Hill uses his terrific understated style to bring the gloomy and self-doubting police detective Kurt Wallander to life. Hill&#39;s effective timing always matches the action (Wallander in danger!), the emotion (Wallander&#39;s depression about the state of Swedish society) and even the geography (rainy and bleak). In THE PYRAMID, Henning Mankell goes back in time with five stories that precede the series. We begin with Wallander&#39;s first case as a 21-year-old patrol officer investigating the stabbing of his neighbor on his own time while wooing girlfriend Mona (his ex-wife in all the Wallander novels). The stories end in the late 1980s as the veteran detective finds connections between a plane crash and the execution-style deaths of two elderly shopkeepers. As always, it&#39;s a treat to spend several hours with Mankell, Wallander, and Hill. A.B. � AudioFile 2009, Portland, Maine</p><h2>FDR: The New Deal Years 1933-1937</h2><p><b>FDR: The War President</b> opens as Roosevelt has been re-elected to a third term and the United States is drifting toward a war that has already engulfed Europe. Roosevelt, as commander in chief, statesman, and politician, must navigate a delicate balance between helping those in Europe--while remaining mindful of the forces of isolation both in the Congress and the country--and protecting the gains of the New Deal, upon which he has spent so much of his prestige and power.<br><br>Kenneth S. Davis draws vivid depictions of the lives, characters, and temperaments of the military and political personalities so paramount to the history of the time: Churchill, Stalin, de Gaulle, and Hitler; Generals Marshall, Eisenhower, and MacArthur; Admiral Darlan, Chiang Kai-shek, Charles Lindbergh, William Allen White, Joseph Kennedy, Averell Harriman, Harry Tru-man, Robert Murphy, Sidney Hillman, William Knud-sen, Cordell Hull, Henry Morgenthau, Henry Stimson, A. Philip Randolph, Wendell Willkie, and Henry Wallace.<br><br>The portrait of Henry Hopkins, who interacted with many of these personalities on behalf of Roosevelt, is woven into this history as the complex, interconnected relationship it was. Hopkins burnished the relationship between Churchill and Roosevelt and eased the way for their interactions with Stalin.<br><br>Another set of characters central to Roosevelt's life and finely drawn by the author includes Eleanor Roo-sevelt, Sara Roosevelt, Missy LeHand, Grace Tully, Princess Martha of Norway, and Daisy Suckley.<br><br>Integral to this history as well are the Argentina Conference, the Atlantic Charter and the beginnings of the United Nations, the Moscow Conference, lend-lease, the story of the building of the atomic bomb, Hitler's Final Solution and how Roosevelt and the State Department reacted to it, Pearl Harbor and war with Japan, the planning of Torch, and the murder of Admiral Darlan. All these stories intersect with the economic and social problems facing Roosevelt at home as the United States mobilizes for war.<br><br>The lessons and concerns of 1940-1943 as dissected in this book are still relevant to the problems and concerns of our own time. A recurrent theme is technology: Do people control technology, or does technology control people?<br><br>Kenneth Davis had the rare gift of writing history that reads with the immediacy of a novel; and though the outcome of this history is well known, the events and people depicted here keep the reader focused on an enthralling suspense story.</p><p>A biographer of <b>Eisenhower</b>, <b>Lindbergh</b>, and <b>Adlai Stevenson</b> as well as a novelist, Kenneth S. Davis was awarded the prestigious Francis Parkman Prize for <b>FDR: The Beckoning of Destiny</b>, which was also a nominee for the National Book Award. In addition, his next two volumes on FDR were both chosen as among the ten best books of the year by <i>The New York Times</i>.<br><br>A graduate of Kansas State University, with a master of science degree from the University of Wisconsin and an honorary doctorate of letters from Assumption College, Davis was a journalism instructor at New York University, a war correspondent attached to General Eisenhower's headquarters, special assistant to Milton Eisenhower, the president of Kansas State University, a member of the State Department's UNESCO relations staff, editor of The Newberry Library Bulletin in Chicago, adjunct professor of English at Clark University, and an adjunct professor of history at both Kansas University and Kansas State University. Kenneth S. Davis died in June 1999.<b>BOOK ONE<br><br>A Guided Drift Toward War<br><br>Overture: Themes, Issues, Recapitulations</b><br><br>"We are facing difficult days in this country, but I think you will find me in the future just the same Franklin Roosevelt you have known a great many years."<br><br>Roosevelt had spoken these words at midnight of the night before (it was now Wednesday morning, November 6, 1940) to a jubilant crowd of Hyde Park neighbors gathered on the wide Big House lawn&#x2014;a crowd that had come in torchlight parade to celebrate with him his election to an unprecedented third term as President of the United States, defeating Republican challenger Wendell Willkie&#x2014;and the promise thus made, despite being rendered strangely tentative and even dubious by the prefatory "I think," was evidently intended by him to soothe, to reassure. It failed to do so, however, for everyone who listened to it or read it in the papers. There were critical and well-informed minds in which the promise raised questions of identity that, viewed in terms of the future now rising as black clouds out of Europe, out of Asia, to cast gloom over the Republic,<br>were both difficult to answer and profoundly disturbing.<br><br>Was this "Franklin Roosevelt" whom his listeners had "known a great many years" actually and wholly the Roosevelt upon whom now depended so much of the fate of America and, indeed, the world? Or was the "real" Franklin Roosevelt a man different in important ways, and perhaps contradictory ways, from his Hyde Park friends' perception of him? In either case, but especially in the latter, to what extent and in what ways would his remaining "just the same" be a boon for mankind, to what extent and in what ways a misfortune, in the "difficult days" to come?<br><br><b>II</b><br><br>The man popularly perceived, the man whose face at midnight had been cooled by a mild springlike breeze as it was imbued by ruddy torchlight, was a big, warm, friendly, compassionate man with an acute sense of justice and a strong commitment to it. Through all the fifty-seven years<br>of his life (he would be fifty-eight this coming January 30) he had been a lover of simple country living. He disliked cities, though his most solid political support came from urban areas, and had in the past, in public speech, more than hinted a belief that virtue, discouraged by the frenetic<br>artificiality of crowded streets, could come to its full flowering only amid green growing things in such landscapes as the one he saw this morning out his bedroom window. For though the green growth was now in autumn retreat at Hyde Park, the hardwoods leafless, the evergreens nearly<br>black, the fields and meadows gray and brown and swept by chill winds under a darkly lowering sky (the weather, he noted, had greatly changed since midnight)&#x2014;though this was so, and though the present melancholy of it was felt, the window-framed landscape of wide fields and wild-wooded<br>hills was yet seen through memory's eyes as a greenly living one. Through it, nourishing and ordering it, flowed the great theme-river of his life, the mighty Hudson, upon whose wide bosom he had spent many of his happiest youthful hours in sailboat and iceboat and from whose bank he and his devoted friend Louis Howe had launched the model sailboats they designed and built together during his long convalescence, as a middle-aged man, from near fatal illness. It now presented itself to his vision, beyond a fringe of treetop, as more lake than stream. A small inland sea. And it<br>was in fact both an active arm of the sea and an active contributor of water to the sea, for it was one of the longest estuaries on earth, as Roosevelt had learned as a boy. Already, as it made its slow curve around Crum Elbow, it sometimes tasted faintly of the salt of the sea that flowed into it, if meagerly, at high tide, and into which soon it must die. Such facts greatly interested, and were known to interest, the man whom his neighbors had long known. He collected them avidly and, his admiring neighbors would have said, they now richly furnished a mind remarkable for<br>its capacity.<br><br>Many of these neighbors knew, as we know, that his collecting of facts, like his collecting of stamps, old books, naval prints, and the like, had been a major part of the psychological strategy he had employed, to sustain his morale, in the long hard war he had waged&#x2014;much of it in this house, in this very room&#x2014;against the crippling effects of the polio that had struck him down in 1921, when he was thirty-nine. It was a war he had declared in the innermost recesses of his being, and to everyone around him, while he was yet wholly bedridden, unable even to sit erect. With an iron determination whose grimness he masked with smiling outward confidence, even gaiety, he had set out to conquer and destroy his affliction. He would walk again! He would walk unaided, without leg braces or crutches or canes! Alas, he never did. He became more mobile, less helpless physically, than had seemed possible to his doctors at the outset of his war, but no amount of willpower or arduous physical effort (he expended prodigious quantities of both) could regrow destroyed nerve tissue. In 1928, when his return to active political life forced him to suspend his recovery regimen after seven years of harsh effort, his legs yet remained nearly fleshless, hardly more than sticks of bone draped in wrinkled skin, and were almost totally unresponsive to his will. His public "walking" and "standing," in 1928 as in 1940, were difficult and often painful balancing acts on what were in effect stilts (steel rods locked around hips, knees, ankles), possible only if he leaned heavily on canes or had beside him a strong man whose arm he could grip. Nevertheless, his struggle had been far from fruitless. During it, as his neighbors knew, he had manifest and further developed an almost incredible fortitude, patience, and emotional self-control&#x2014;a self-mastery that was part and parcel of his mastery of other people.<br><br>Discerned by some of the more acute of those who observed him with close attention, though from a distance, was the fact that his very disability had become in his way of handling it a source, an instrument, a protector and preserver of personal power. As regards this last, it prevented risk-engendering importunities that he could not have avoided, save at the further and possibly greater political risk of giving offense, had he been able to move freely about and therefore compelled to mingle casually with other people on occasions and grounds not of his choosing. The compulsion was now all the other way: people must come to him, and they must come always, to some extent, at least, with formality&#x2014;that is, in accordance with formal rules whereby they were placed at an initial disadvantage insofar as their dealings with him were of an adversarial nature. This was true even in situations where his actual need for their support was considerably greater than theirs for his. For since they came as invited guests into his house, or by his permission into his office or onto other ground ruled by him, they came perforce under felt obligations and must<br>assume in some degree, willy-nilly, a supplicatory attitude. By the manner of his welcome or greeting he could and did set the tone of every personal encounter and, having done so, could and did dominate the discussion.<br><br>Similar in effect, but different psychologically, was the way in which his physical handicap became per se a source and instrument of governing power. Conjoined or (more precisely) fused with the self-mastery he had gained through his struggle to overcome it, his perceived handicap, in part by weakening in other people their inward resistance to his will, actually increased his persuasiveness and enhanced his ability to command through sheer force of personality. It commonly made these others want at the outset to please, emulate, and, if at all possible, agree with this man who demonstrated so much courage, strength of character, and optimistic confidence&#x2014;so much liking and concern for them personally, such sweetness of disposition&#x2014;under pressures that would have crushed an ordinary mortal into chronic depression and resentful dependency. Moreover there was a natural assumption on the part of people in general, an assumption abundantly encouraged by his careful management of his public image, that he had earned through his prolonged and terrible ordeal a compassionate living wisdom remarkable for its width and depth. He was therefore commonly deemed more likely to be right than his opponents were on issues concerning which the common view was not well informed. He might be so even on issues of which his own factual knowledge was meager: his "intuition" was famous, was encouraged by him so to be&#x2014;an ability, as it seemed, to dispense with logical process as he plunged with lightning swiftness into the heart of a difficult problem and discovered there its solution&#x2014;and though it was presumed that he had been born with this uncanny ability, it was further presumed that prolonged anguish and arduous struggle had sharpened and strengthened it.</p><h2>The Food Journal of Lewis &amp; Clark: Recipes for an Expedition</h2><p>This award-winning cookbook and history book brings history alive with engaging writing, the travelers&#39; own words, and authentic, yet appealing recipes.

The fever that grips college basketball prospects hoping to strike big-time NBA gold afflicts coaches, parents, and sneaker executives as well. Every one of them has a stake in keeping America&#x2019;s wildly dysfunctional, incredibly lucrative youth basketball machine up and running&#x2014;no matter the consequences.<br><br> In<i> Play Their Hearts Out</i>, George Dohrmann offers an up-close and unforgettable look inside the maw of that machine. He shares what he learned from his years spent embedded with a group of talented young recruits from Southern California as they traveled the country playing in elite Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) events. It&#x2019;s a cutthroat world where boys as young as eight or nine are subjected to a dizzying torrent of scrutiny and exploitation. Coaches vie to have them on their teams. Sneaker companies ply them with free shoes and gear. &#x201c;All-star camps&#x201d; are glorified cattle auctions, providing make-or-break opportunities to secure the promise of an elusive college scholarship. <br> &nbsp;<br> At the book&#x2019;s heart are the personal stories of two compelling figures: Joe Keller, an ambitious AAU coach with a master plan to find and promote &#x201c;the next LeBron&#x201d;&#x2014;thereby paving his own path to power and riches; and Demetrius Walker, a fatherless latchkey kid who falls under Keller&#x2019;s sway and struggles to live up to the unrealistic expectations his supposed benefactor has set for him. As their fortunes take shape and the pressure mounts&#x2014;Demetrius finds himself profiled in Sports Illustrated at age fourteen, while Keller cultivates his business empire&#x2014;Dohrmann weaves in the stories of numerous other parents, coaches, and players. Some of them see their prospects evaporate as a result of poor decisions and worse luck. Others learn how to thrive in a corrupt system by playing the right angles.<br><br> Written with incomparable detail and insight, <i>Play Their Hearts Out</i> is a thoroughly unique narrative that reveals the inner workings of an American game, exposing the gritty reality that lies beneath so many dreams of fame and glory.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, October 2010</strong>: Each year, millions of grammar school athletes swarm fields and courts armed with little more than an infectious love for their games. These endeavors represent the purity of sport, as kids are allowed to be kids and compete outside the demands of lucrative contracts and extensive media coverage. Yet sadly, as George Dohrmann's Play <em>Their Hearts Out</em> demonstrates, such a paradise is fading fast in today's corporate sports world. Dohrmann provides a first-hand account of the rise of a nine-year-old basketball phenom and the grassroots programs that both helped and hindered his dreams of superstardom. To call this story a cautionary tale is to sell it short, as <em>Play Their Hearts Out</em> is an unflinching look at the increasing need for hype in youth athletics. Fans of the brilliant <em>Hoop Dreams</em> documentary are advised to add this book to their cart immediately, as Dohrmann's masterful ability to remove himself from the plotline achieves an honesty that leaves any and all judgments to the reader. --<em>Dave Callanan</em> <p></p><p></p> <strong>Photographs from <em>Play Their Hearts Out</em></strong> <p></p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>View Larger</td> <td>View Larger</td> <td>View Larger</td> </tr> </tbody></table><b>George Dohrmann</b> is a senior writer at <i>Sports Illustrated</i> and the magazine&#x2019;s investigative reporter.

The hardcover was considered the number-one management book of 1992.</p><p>&#34;&#34;Each of us lives and works in organizations designed from Newtonian images of the universe&#34;&#34;, Margaret Wheatley writes in this groundbreaking book. &#34;&#34;Our assumptions come to us from seventeenth-century physics, from Newtonian mechanics. . . . But the science has changed. If we are to continue to draw from the sciences to create and manage organizations, then we need to at least ground our work in the science of our times. We need to stop seeking after the universe of the seventeenth century and begin to explore what has become known to us in the twentieth century&#34;&#34;. Wheatley takes the reader on a mind-opening journey into the &#34;&#34;new science&#34;&#34; - the revolutionary discoveries in quantum physics, chaos theory, and molecular biology that are changing our understanding of the universe. And she applies these scientific concepts to offer new light on the fundamental issues of organizing work, people, and life, including: how can we find order in a chaotic world?; how is order different than control?; how can we create more participative, open, and adaptive organizations?; how can we reconcile individual autonomy and organizational control?; and what leads to organizational growth and self-renewal instead of decline and death?Margeret Wheatley, EdD, writes, teaches and speaks about how to restore hope and sanity to organizations.

Dr. MacLeod has brought in an interpreter, Flore, to help him evaluate Emma&#39;s fitness to stand trial. &#34;Both crazy and too lucid,&#34; an articulate and knowledgeable Emma relates her long battle against despair, through striking images of her lonely but determined and creative struggle to win the love of a mother misled by a racist society and then through tales of the suffering and resistance of some of her female forebears. These narratives, which are both epic and dramatic, and their contrasting reception by the officious psychiatrist and the sensitive Flore, produce rich layers of experience and meaning in this concisely narrated work. Flore recognizes Emma&#39;s faithfulness to her ancestors&#39; struggle and their wisdom, both in her desperate gesture to save her child from the cruel humiliations of prejudice and in her definitive act of rejoining her ancestors when she has effectively fulfilled her duty to pass on the memory, theirs and hers, to guide her successors, like Flore.</p><p>Born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, Marie-C�lie Agnant has lived in Montreal since 1970.

I looked up at the sky above the distant Hlaza Hill, the highest point on the new community game reserve that abuts Thula Thula, my own reserve and my home in Zululand, South Africa.

The rhino lay uncharacteristically on her side, legs splayed awkwardly at right angles to her stiff body.</p><p>I got out of the Land Rover and walked across to the three rangers standing nearby.

The regal horns, viciously hacked off with honed machetes - or pangas, as we call them in Africa - left the noble face crumpled and desecrated. The eyes gazed vacantly. Pools of blood had congealed around the grotesquely disfigured head. Without its horn, the imposing creature looked as vulnerable as a baby.</p><p>I could see my own turmoil mirrored in the rangers' faces. In Africa, the war against poachers is intensely personal. There are two types of poacher: the local tribesman looking for something small for the pot; and the heavyweights, the professional killers, who want rhino horn and elephant ivory, who will shoot a ranger then brag about it. Poaching any animal is a crime, but killing a rhino or elephant is not shooting to feed a hungry family. It's blood money. And it's an intimate, violent invasion of our lives.</p><p>'Who found the body?'</p><p>Bheki, my most trusted ranger, looked up and pointed at a young Zulu guard, Simelane, standing a little way off. I beckoned for him to come over.</p><p>'Sawubona, Simelane,' I greeted him. 'What happened here?'</p><p>'Sawubona, Mkhulu. I was on patrol when I saw the dead rhino,' he replied quietly, staring at the ground.</p><p>'Who was with you?'</p><p>'I was alone.'</p><p>'You were on patrol out here all alone?' I asked, surprised. Poaching patrols always consisted of two armed men.</p><p>'Yes, I was alone.' He was barely whispering.</p><p>I was about to press on with the questioning when a loud Zulu voice interrupted me.</p><p>'Mkhulu, there is too much blood.'</p><p>It was Bheki, down on one knee closely examining the rhino's head.</p><p>'There is too much blood,' he repeated. 'That means they were in a hurry. They took the horns while she was still alive. Maybe unconscious, but alive.'</p><p>For a moment we just stared at Bheki. Then it sank in. These monsters had hacked the horn off a living animal.</p><p>'Which way did they go?' I asked Bheki, who had been at my side in several firefights with poachers over the past decade.</p><p>He pointed east. 'Four, maybe five hours ago.'</p><p>That meant that unless they were in hiding, they would be almost out of the reserve and heading towards the townships, where we would never catch them. However, that didn't mean we wouldn't try. At the very least, it would give us something physical to do to vent our fury.</p><p>'OK, we all know the drill,' I said. 'These guys are probably carrying AKs and we all know what that means. If we make contact and they so much as think of lifting their rifles, shoot fast and shoot first, as we'll be up against automatic fire.'</p><p>I looked at the solemn faces. Armed only with shotguns and Second World War-era Lee-Enfield .303 bolt-action rifles, they were completely out-gunned, but that would not deter these hard, dedicated men for a moment. They would be facing automatic weapons, replying as fast as their wrists could work their rifle bolts. You cannot imagine the courage that takes. I had a pump-action shotgun that was fast and deadly and spread nine lead balls in a lethal cluster. Our weapons complemented each other well. The .303s had a longer range than an AK, and the shotguns at close quarters in thick bush didn't miss. Used in tandem they were a match for the illegal AK-47s so favoured by poachers. 'Bring your own water and keep your safety catches on. Let's go!' We would be moving as fast as we could in thick bush, and I didn't want anyone tripping and blasting the person ahead of them.</p><p>The going was tough and by mid-morning we were well off the beaten path, following barely discernible game trails used by the poachers. The sun burned relentlessly, a typical Zululand scorcher, and sweat poured from our bodies, stinging our eyes and drenching our shirts. But hyped up with adrenalin and anticipation, we never eased our blistering pace. If we faltered, any slim chance of catching them would be lost.</p><p>It's difficult to remain calm when you see a rhino brutally slaughtered for a horn that consists of little more than keratin, the same fibrous structural protein you find in hair and fingernails. In fact, it's impossible. You're more likely to be consumed by raging fury, but that won't do any good. Rhino horns are used for mythical medicinal purposes in countries across Asia, as part of their traditional healing systems. In traditional Chinese medicine it is believed to cure types of fever, for instance. And the increasing wealth of these economies has created an insatiable demand. Tens of thousands of rhino have been killed in Africa, with several subspecies hunted to extinction. The demand is reminiscent of a nineteenth-century gold rush, and with good reason. On the streets of China or Vietnam, ounce for ounce the horn is more valuable than gold. If you truly want to grasp the situation faced by conservationists, do what a poacher does and look at a rhino and see a three-foot-long horn made of pure gold. Game rangers are in the unenviable and extremely hazardous position of trying to protect solid gold. What should be locked securely in a vault instead walks around on four legs in the bush.</p><p>It is not an exaggeration to say that every rhino on the planet is now in mortal danger. Unless something fundamental changes, and quickly, every last one in the wild will eventually be killed.</p><p>As we pushed on, we periodically picked up traces of the killers' trail, such as footprints, a small patch of flattened grass, a marked tree or flecks of blood, probably oozing from the horn that the killers would be carrying in a hessian sack. These signs that we were on the right track provided the edge we needed, with Bheki urging us to speed up the chase.</p><p>However, Simelane, the young Zulu ranger who had discovered the dead rhino, was starting to worry me. Twice he veered off into the bush alone, following false leads and losing us valuable time. Maybe his strange behaviour was due to the stress of tracking the killers, I thought, as well as the possibility of an ambush around the next corner.</p><p>An ambush was my biggest worry. The penalty in South Africa for rhino poaching is a fifteen-year jail sentence and there was no way these professional killers were going to risk being sent away for that long. They knew it and we knew it. If the killers sensed they were being followed and were waiting for us, there is no doubt we would be in a lethal firefight - at close quarters, in thick bush, with minimum visibility and maximum chaos.</p><p>Eventually the punishing pace took its toll. I called a halt for a brief rest and sent one of the rangers ahead to high ground to try and pick them out from above.</p><p>'Nothing,' came the reply on the radio from a nearby hill. 'I see nothing.'</p><p>I could tell by the frustrated look on Bheki's face as we waited that the spoor was now cold. We were too late; and, sure enough, a couple of hours later when we finally reached the boundary fence, all we found was a slash where they had snipped through the wire, carefully avoiding the electric strands. They were well and truly gone.</p><p>'Next time,' I heard Bheki whisper as he unloaded his .303. 'We will get them next time, Mkhulu.'</p><p>I nodded silently, also unloading my shotgun as we started the long trek back.</p><p>At home, I reported the incident, first to the police and then to our local Parks authority, KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife. The latter phone call was tough, as they had just donated the now dead animal to a project I was working on. I was joining my reserve, Thula Thula, with the huge Zulu tribal trust areas to form what we believed would be one of the finest game reserves in the country. It was to be called the Royal Zulu and would be a unique joint venture with local tribes. The project would provide meaningful benefits to poor rural communities through conservation and eco-tourism, giving them a stake in the future of the African wilderness. Thanks to years of apartheid when game reserves had been racially exclusive, man...</p></p><h2>Liderazgo Con Proposito (Spanish Edition)</h2><p>In these twelve chapters about leadership, Pastor Rick Warren examines the life and ministry of Nehemiah.

You might go around the market all day and never find a single spirit who would trade you a fresh egg for it. Yet it holds...<br>Enough.<br>Yes, enough. I am sick of fancies.<br>* * *<br>At present it holds two quills, for I have taken the third one out. Two were in it when I found it in the ashes of our shop. The third, with which I am writing, was dropped by Oreb not so long ago. I picked it up, put it in this pen case, and forgot both Oreb and his feather.<br>It also holds a knife for pointing pens and the small bottle of black ink (more than half full) into which I dip mine. See how much darker my writing has become.<br>* * *<br>It is facts I need--facts I starve for. To Green with fancies!<br>My name is Horn.<br>This is such a pen case as students use in Viron, the city in which I was born, and no doubt in many others--a case of black leather glued over pressboard; it has a brass hinge with a steel spring, and a little brass clamp to keep it shut. We sold them in our shop and asked six cardbits; but my father would accept four if the purchaser bargained awhile, and such purchasers always did.<br>Three, if they bought something else, a quire of writing paper, say.<br>* * *<br>The leather is badly scuffed. More facts later, when I have more time. Rajya Mantri wants to lecture me.<br>* * *<br>Reviewing what I wrote yesterday, I see that I have begun without plan or foresight, and in fact without the least notion of what I was trying to do or why I was trying to do it. That is how I have begun everything in life. Perhaps I need to begin before I can think clearly about the task. The chief thing is to begin, after all--after which the chief thing is to finish. I have finished worse than I began, for the most part.<br>It is all in the pen case. You have to take out the ink and string it together into the right shapes. That is all.<br>* * *<br>If I had not picked up this old pen case where my father's shop once stood, it is possible that I might still be searching for Silk. <br>For the phantom who has eluded me on three whorls.<br>* * *<br>Silk may be here on Blue already, after all. I have dispatched letters to Han and some other towns, and we will see. It is convenient, I find, to have messengers at one's beck and call.<br>So I am searching here, although I am the only person here in Gaon who could not tell you where to find him. Searching does not necessarily imply movement. Thinking it does, or rather assuming it without thought, may have been my first and worst mistake.<br>Thus I continue to search, true to my oath. I question travelers, and I write new letters subtracting some facts and adding others, composing flatteries and threats I hope will bring this town and that to my assistance; no doubt my scribe thinks I am penning another such letter at this moment, a letter that he, poor fellow, will have to copy out with broad, fair flourishes upon sheepskins scraped thin.<br>We need a paper mill here, and it is the only thing that I am competent to do.<br>* * *<br>I wish Oreb were here.<br>* * *<br>Now that I know what I mean to do, I can begin. But not at the beginning. To begin at the beginning would consume far too much time and paper, to say nothing of ink. I am going to begin, when I do, just a day or two before the moment at which I put to sea in the sloop.<br>Tomorrow then, when I have had time to decide how best to tell the convoluted tale of my long, vain search for Patera Silk--for Silk my ideal, who was the augur of our manteion in the Sun Street Quarter of Our Sacred City of Viron in the belly of the <i>Whorl</i>.<br>When I was young.<br>* * *<br>The mainshaft had split--I remember that. I was taking it out of the journals when one of the twins ran in. I believe it was Hide. "A boat's coming! A big boat's coming!"<br>I told him that they probably wanted to buy a few bales, and that his mother could sell it to them as well as I could.<br>"Sinew's here, too."<br>Just to get rid of Hide, I told him to tell his mother about it. When he had gone, I got my needler from its hiding place and stuck it in my waistband under my greasy tunic.<br>Sinew was stamping up and down the beach, lovely shells of purple, rose, and purest white snapping beneath his boots. He looked surly when he saw me, so I told him to bring the good telescope out of the sloop. He would have defied me if he had possessed the courage. For half a minute we stood eye to eye; then he turned and went. I thought he was leaving, that he would put out for the mainland in his coracle and stay there for a week or a month, which to tell the truth I wanted much more than my telescope.<br>The boat they came in was indeed large. I know I counted at least a dozen sails. It carried a couple of jibs, three sails on each of its big masts, and staysails. I had never seen a boat big enough to set staysails between its masts before, so I am sure of those.<br>Sinew came back with the telescope. I asked whether he wanted the first look, and he sneered at me. It was always a mistake to try to treat him with any courtesy in those days, and I could have kicked myself for it. I put the telescope to my eye, wondering what Sinew was doing the second I could no longer watch him.<br>It was a good instrument, made in Dorp they said, where they are good sailors and grind good lenses. (We were good sailors in New Viron, too--or thought we were--but did not grind lenses at all.) Through it I could see the faces at the gunwale, all looking toward Tail Bay, for which their boat was plainly making. Its hull was white above and black below--I recall that, too. Here on Blue the sea is silver where it is not so dark a blue that it seems it might dye cloth, not at all like Lake Limna at home where the waves were nearly always green.<br>I had become used to Blue's blue and silver sea long ago, of course. Perhaps I only think of it now because we are so far from it here in Gaon; but it seems to me, as I sit here to write at this beautifully inlaid table the Gaonese have provided for me, that I saw it then through the glass as though it were new, that there was some magic carried in the big black and white boat that made Blue new to me again. Perhaps there was, for boats are magic--living things that ordinary men like me can shape from wood and iron.<br>"Probably pirates," Sinew snarled.<br>I took my eye from the telescope and saw that he had his long, steel-hilted hunting knife out and was testing its edge with his thumb. Sinew could never sharpen a knife properly (Nettle did it for him in those days), although he pretended he could; but for a moment before I returned to my study of the boat, I wondered whether he would not stab me and try to join them if pirates in fact came again. Then I put my eye back to the telescope, and saw that the faces at the gunwale included a woman's, and that one of the men was old Patera Remora. I should make it clear here that he and Marrow were the only ones I knew well.<br>There were five besides Gyrfalcon's sailors, who had been brought along to work the boat. Perhaps I ought to list all five now and describe them, since Nettle may want to show this to others. You would do everything much better, darling, I know, working in the descriptions cleverly as you did when we wrote <i>The Book of Silk</i>; but it is a skill I have never possessed to the same degree.<br>No doubt you remember them better than I, as well.<br>* * *<br>Gyrfalcon is fat, with busy eyes, a noble face, and a mop of sinknut-brown hair just starting to turn gray. It was his boat, and he let us know that the moment that he came ashore. Do you remember?<br>* * *<br>Eschar is tall and stooped, with a long, sad face, slow to speak until his passions are roused. He was on our lander, of course, just as Marrow and Remora were.<br>* * *<br>The woman came later, perhaps on Gyrfalcon's lander. Her name is Blazingstar. She has humor, as you do, a rare thing in a woman. I know you liked her, and so did I. She talked about her farms, so she must own at least two in addition to her trading company.<br>* * *<br>Marrow is large and solid, not so fat as he was at home, but balder even than I was then. When we were children, he owned a greengrocery as well as his fruit stall in the market. He still deals in vegetables and fruits mostly, I believe. I have never known him to cheat anyone, and he can be generous; but I would like to meet the man who can best him in a bargain. Marrow was the only one of the five who helped me after I was robbed in New Viron.<br>* * *<br>His Cognizance Patera Remora is of course the head of the Vironese Faith--quite tall but not muscular, with lank gray hair he wears too long. He was at one time coadjutor in Old Viron (as we say it here). A good and a kind man, not as shrewd as he believes, prone to be too careful.<br>* * *<br>They were too many for our little house. Hoof and Hide and I made a rude table on the beach, laying planks across boxes and barrels and bales of paper. Sinew carried out all the chairs, I brought the high and low stools I use in the mill, and you spread the planks with cloths and set what little cheer we had before our uninvited guests. And so we managed to entertain all five, and even Gyrfalcon's sailors, with some show of decency.<br>Marrow rapped the makeshift table, calling us to order. Our sons and the sailors were sitting on the beach, nudging one another, whispering, and tossing shells and pebbles into the silver waves. I would have sent them all away if I could. It did not seem to be my place to do so, and Marrow let them stay.<br>"First let me thank you both for your hospitality," he began. "You owe us no favors, since we have come to ask you for a big one--"<br>Gyrfalcon interrupted, saying, "To grant you a privilege." From the way he spoke, I felt sure that they had argued about this already.<br>Marrow shrugged. "I should have begun by explaining who we are. You know our names now, and even though you live so far from town, it's likely that you also know we're its five richest citizens."<br>Remora cleared his throat. "Not, um, so. No--ah--intent to, um, contradict, but not, er, I."<br>"Your Chapter's got more gelt than any of us," Eschar remarked dryly.<br>"Not mine, hey? Custodian--um-solely." The sweet salt wind ruffled his hair, making him look at once foolish and blessed.<br>Blazingstar spoke first to you, Nettle; then to me. "We are the five people who have jockeyed most successfully for money and power, that's all. We wanted them, we five, and we got them. Now here we are, begging you two to keep us from cutting our own throats."<br>"Not, um--"<br>"He'll deny it," she told us, "but it's the gods' own truth just the same. Our money belongs to us, mine to me, Gyrfalcon's to him, and so on. Patera here is going to insist that his isn't really his, that it belongs to the Chapter and he only takes care of it."<br>"Brava! Quite--um--ah...Precisely the case."<br>"But he's got it, and as Eschar said he's probably got more than any of us. He's got bravos, too, buckos to break heads for him whenever he wants."<br>Stubbornly, Remora shook his own. "There are many men of--ah--high heart amongst the faithful. That I, um, concede. However, we--ah--none--"<br>"He doesn't have to pay his," Blazingstar explained. "We pay ours."<br>Eschar asked Remora, "If it isn't so, what are you doing here?"<br>Marrow rapped the table again. "That's who we are. Do you understand now?"<br>You looked at me then, Nettle darling, inviting me to speak; but all I could think of to say was. "I don't think so."<br>Marrow said, "You don't know why we're here, naturally. We haven't told you. That will come soon enough."<br>Gyrfalcon snapped, "New Viron needs a cald�. Anybody can see it."<br>You nodded then, Nettle darling. "It's become a terrible place."<br>"Exactly. We came here to escape the Sun Street Quarter, didn't we? The Sun Street Quarter and the Orilla." Gyrfalcon chuckled. "But we carried them with us."<br>&nbsp;"It isn't just crime," Blazingstar declared, "though there's much too much of that. The wells are polluted and there's filth everywhere."<br>&nbsp;Gyrfalcon chuckled again. "Just like home."<br>"Worse. Filth and flies. Rats. It isn't just that the people want a cald�, though they do. <i>We</i> do. We're businesspeople at base, all of us. Traders and merchants. Sharpers, if you like."<br>"I must--ah," Remora began.<br>"All right, all except His Cognizance, who never hedges the truth even a finger's width. Or so he says." Blazingstar gave Remora a scornful smile. "But the rest of us need to carry on our businesses, and it's become almost impossible to do that in New Viron."<br>Marrow added, "And getting worse."<br>"Getting worse. Exactly."<br>You asked, "Can't one of you be cald�?"<br>Gyrfalcon laughed aloud at that; he has a good, booming laugh. "Suppose one of us became cald� tomorrow. How about old Marrow there? He wants it."<br>"I feel sure it would be a wonderful improvement."<br>Marrow thanked you. "For you and your family it would be, Nettle. What do think it would be for them?" He glanced around at Gyrfalcon, Remora, Eschar, and Blazingstar.<br>"An improvement, too, I think."<br>"Not a bit of it." Marrow had rapped the table before; now he struck it with his fist, rattling our mugs and plates. "I would take everything I could get. I would do my best to ruin them, and if you ask me I would succeed." He smiled, and glanced around at the woman and the three men I had believed were his friends. "They know it well, my dear. And, Nettle, they would do the same to me."<br>Eschar told you, "We need Cald� Silk here. I was the first to suggest it."<br>"He's still in the <i>Whorl</i>, isn't he? And...I don't like to say this."<br>"Then I will." Blazingstar reached across the table we had made to cover your hand with her own. "He may be dead. I left sixteen years ago, and by this time it's certainly possible."<br>"Hem!" Remora cleared his throat. "Theocracy, hey? I have suggested it, but they will, er, won't. Not if--ah--me. But, um, Patera Silk, eh? Yes. Yes, to that. Third party. Still an augur, eh? Indelible--ah--consecration. So, um. Modified? A mitigated theocracy. We, um, two in concert. I concur."<br>Gryfalcon summed up, "It's that or we fight, and a fight would destroy the town, and all of us, too, in all probability. Show them the letter, Marrow."<br>* * *<br>Hari Mau and I have formalized the court. Up until now, it seems, litigants have simply done whatever they could to come before the rajan (as their ruler was called at home) and made their cases. Witnesses were or were not called, and so forth. We have set up a system--tentative, of course, but it <i>is</i> a system--in a situation in which any system at all will surely be an improvement. Unless they choose otherwise, Nauvan will represent all the plaintiffs, and Somvar all the defendants. It will be their duty to see that evidence, witnesses, and so forth are present when I hear the case. In criminal cases, I will assign one or the other to prosecute, depending.<br>I feel like Vulpes.<br>They will have to be paid, of course; but demanding fees from both parties should encourage them to come to agreement, so that may work out well. Besides, there will be fines.

It was as if the black wood of the bedposts were meant to root us Walker women to this place of flat fields and fertile soil carved from the great Mississippi. But like the levees built to control the mighty river, it never held us for long.</p><p>We were born screaming into this world, the beginning of a lifelong quest to find what would quiet us. Our legacy was our ability to coax living things from fallow ground, along with a desperate need to see what lay beyond the delta. A need to quell a hurt whose source was as unexplainable as its force.</p><p>Whatever it was that drove us away was never stronger than the pull of what brought us back. Maybe it was the feel of the dark Mississippi mud or the memory of the old house and the black bed into which we&#x2019;d been born, but no matter how far we ran, we always came back.</p><p>I returned in the spring nearly nine years to the day after I&#x2019;d left. I&#x2019;d driven straight through from Los Angeles, twenty-seven hours of asphalt and fast food, my memories like a string guiding me home. The last leg from Little Rock to Indian Mound was punctuated by bright flashes of lightning and constant tornado watches on the radio. I kept my foot pressed to the accelerator as strong winds buffeted my car. It didn&#x2019;t occur to me to stop. I had a trunk&#x2019;s worth of hurts piled in the car with me that only my grandmother Bootsie could make go away. She would forgive those long years of silence because she understood doggedness. I&#x2019;d inherited it from her side of the family, after all.</p><p>It was nearly dawn when the storm passed and I crossed the river into Mississippi and headed east on Highway 82 and into the heart of the delta. The hills and bluffs to the west disappeared as if a giant boot had flattened all the land between the Mississippi and Yazoo rivers, creating a landscape as rich and fertile as it was difficult to contain and control. This place of my ancestors was known to make or break a man, and I figured by now the scorecard was about even.</p><p><i>I&#x2019;ve been a long time gone.</i> Billboards and highway lights fell away, leaving behind empty fields and ramshackle structures swallowed by kudzu, turning them into hulking ghosts haunting the roadside. Sinewy cypress swamps randomly appeared as if to remind us of our tenuous hold on the land. The predawn flatscape flashed by me in shades of gray, as if the years had absorbed all the color, so that even my memories were seen only in black and white.</p><p>A therapist had once told me that my hindsight color blindness was due to an unhappy childhood. I tried to tell him that I had never considered my motherless childhood to be <i>unhappy.</i> It was more of an accumulation of years filled with absence, that perhaps black and white were simply the colors of grief.</p><p>The rising sun had painted the sky pink by the time I passed the sign for Indian Mound, the first seeds of panic making my heart beat faster. I glanced over at my purse, where I kept my pills, wondering whether I could swallow them dry again as I&#x2019;d been doing for most of the trip. My throat felt sore, and my hands shook. <i>I&#x2019;m almost home</i>. I turned my gaze toward the dim light outside that seemed to swallow my car as I passed through it, and pressed my foot harder on the accelerator.</p><p>I slowed down, trying to avoid the increasing amount of debris tossed across the road, the tree limbs, leaves, and roof shingles that seemed to have been scattered by the hand of a careless child. I caught up to an old, faded red pickup truck as it slowed down at the bright flashing red and blue lights of a police car stopped in front of fallen electrical lines. A large, brindled dog, his lineage as indecipherable as the vintage of the pickup truck in which he sat, stared at me with a lost expression. A police officer guided our way around the danger zone, his other hand reminding us to slow down. As soon as he had disappeared from my rearview mirror, I sped up, passing the truck and maneuvering past a mailbox that stood upright in the middle of the highway as if it were meant to be there.</p><p>My tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth and I thought of the pills again, and how easily they could take away the pit of worry that had begun to gnaw at me. I went faster, clipping a tree limb with my left front tire and hearing a crack and a thump of the split wood hitting metal. I kept going, realizing that I was prepared to drive on the rim of a flat tire if I had to. <i>I&#x2019;ve been a long time gone.</i></p><p>I turned off the highway onto a dirt road studded with puddles and rocks. The road bisected a large cotton field, the furrows drowning in standing water. I remembered this road and had turned by instinct. It probably had a name, one we&#x2019;d never used when giving directions to the odd visitor. We usually instructed visitors to turn right about one and a half miles past the old general store, which leaned to the left and still had a Royal Crown Cola sign plastered over the doorway even though it had been abandoned long before I was born.</p><p>The store was gone now, but I still knew where to turn in the same way my hair still knew where to part no matter how hard I tried to tell it different. But the road was the same, still narrow, with the tall white oaks&#x2014;taller now, I supposed&#x2014;creating a green archway above. Tommy and I used to race barefoot down this road, watching our feet churn up dust like conjured spirits.</p><p>My back tires spun out, bringing me back to the present and slipping my car off the side of the road. Panicking, I gunned the engine, succeeding only in digging the wheels further in muck. Although I knew it was useless, I gunned the engine two more times. I stared through the windshield down the tree-shaded road. It had taken me nine years to come back. I figured stretching it out for a few more minutes wouldn&#x2019;t matter.</p><p>I began to walk, my leather flats sticking to the Mississippi mud as if reluctant to let me go again. A murder of crows sprang up out of the trees, cawing loudly and making my heart hammer as I tried counting them, recalling the nursery rhyme Mathilda had sung to me as a child.</p><p>One for sorrow,</p><p>two for mirth,</p><p>three for a wedding,</p><p>four for a birth,</p><p>five for silver,</p><p>six for gold,</p><p>seven for a secret never to be told,</p><p>eight for heaven,</p><p>nine for hell,</p><p>And ten for the devil&#x2019;s own self.</p><p>I clenched my teeth, wishing I&#x2019;d taken another pill. I glanced over my shoulder at the car, realizing too late that I&#x2019;d left my purse. I&#x2019;d almost decided to go back when a flurry of wings made me look up. Seven black crows, their inky black wings seeming wet in the light of the sun, swirled and dipped over me, cawing and cackling, then took off again across the field.</p><p>My throat stung as I walked faster, feeling light-headed as I tried to recall the last time I&#x2019;d eaten. And then the trees by the side of the road fell away and I stopped in a large clearing with a wide, paved drive edged with centuries-old oak trees. The old yellow house of indeterminate architecture with columns and porches and an improbable turret and at least three different roof styles stood before me in all of its confused splendor. It was an anomaly among all the Greek Revival homes of the region, as peculiar and original as the women who&#x2019;d lived there for two centuries. My heart slowed as if Bootsie were already with me, letting my head rest on her shoulder. I had come home.</p><p>Despite the storm, the house appeared almost untouched except for the litter of pink azalea petals that had been stripped from their stems and scattered around the drive and yard like fuchsia doubloons from a Mardi Gras float.</p><p>Grass blades stuck their tips out of standing water in the yard as if struggling for breath, the water reflecting the sky and odd yellow house. Its windows stared down on me with reproach, as if wondering at the audacity of the return of another Walker woman, my hubris in believing it wanted me back. But I&#x2019;d lived my first eighteen years inside its walls and had run through the fields of cotton that surrounded it. This house was the only spot of color in my monochromatic memories.</p><p>I listened for the songbirds, as much a part of my memory as the landscape. Except for the crows, the only sound cutting the silence was that of dripping water as it fell to the ground from the eaves and chipped paint of the old house, and from the arthritic fingers of the oak trees. I slowly walked up the wooden steps to the wide porch, pausing to take off my mud-caked shoes and leave them by the side of the door, just as I had done as a child. I placed my hand on the large brass knob of the front door before deciding to knock instead.</p><p>I knocked twice, waiting for the tread of my grandmother Bootsie&#x2019;s footsteps, or the glide of my mother&#x2019;s bare feet. Or even the heavier tread of my older brother, Tommy. But all I heard was the sound of the water leaking from the house. <i>Drip. Drip.</i></p><p>I hesitated for a moment, then reached for the knob. It didn&#x2019;t turn. In all of my years growing up, the front door had never been locked. I couldn&#x2019;t help but wonder if they&#x2019;d known I was coming after all. I stood for a moment with my hands on my hips until I remembered it was a stance my mother had frequently used, and dropped them again. The air was heavy with the scent of rain and the boxwoods that had begun to creep over the porch railings unchecked.</p><p>I slid my shoes back on and crossed the drive to walk around the side toward the old carriage house that had been converted into a garage sometime in the twenties. I recognized Bootsie&#x2019;s 1977 white Cadillac convertible and my heart lurched with relief. A white pickup truck with an enormous toolbox in the bed that I assumed was Tommy&#x2019;s sat behind it, and next to it was a dark sedan that looked suspiciously like an unmarked police car. I didn&#x2019;t take the time to think about why it was there. I walked quickly now, no longer caring about avoiding puddles, needing to be embraced by my grandmother until I no longer craved my pills to soothe away the hurting.</p><p>I moved to the backyard, looking toward the rear of our property, toward the forest full of sweet gums and pines, the solid land giving way to the swamp and giant bald cypress trees that Tommy had once told me were over a thousand years old. A lone cypress tree had managed to take root on higher ground halfway between the house and the swamp, standing by itself among the sparse grass and haphazard pine trees whose scraggly branches always made them look bewildered next to the corded majesty of the giant cypress. I&#x2019;d called it &#x201c;my tree&#x201d; as a child, and I longed to sit in the comforting shade of its branches again.</p><p>But the landscape had been altered. Limbs and leaves mixed blindly with papers and other indistinguishable man-made debris. A porch swing that I remembered had once hung on the front porch sat right side up, its chains missing, in the middle of the yard. Close by, almost as if they&#x2019;d been set there on purpose, were the two metal chairs that had always graced my grandmother&#x2019;s vegetable garden. They had once been a neon lime color, but sun and time had faded them into a disappointed green. With the swing, they formed a cohesive seating group, almost as if the wind had decided in the middle of its destruction to take a break.</p><p>I paused, feeling my equilibrium shift as if I&#x2019;d just stepped off a moving sidewalk. I took in the three figures standing in the near distance, and then waited for my gaze to register what they were standing next to, blinking twice until I understood. My tree, the stalwart reminder of the best parts of my childhood, had toppled over, clipping the edge of the old cotton shed. The roots were singed black, with chunks of bark encircling the area. I imagined I could smell the burnt ions in the air from the lightning strike, still feel the atmosphere pulsating with the power of it.</p><p>&#x201c;Bootsie?&#x201d; I called out, my walk becoming a run. Three heads turned in my direction just as another cluster of crows flew out from the dead tree, their shiny black bodies seeming to mock me.</p><p>I stopped in front of the small group, my breath coming in gasps, as we regarded one another, all of us looking as if we&#x2019;d just seen a ghost. Nobody said anything as my gaze moved from one person to another, registering my brother&#x2019;s face, and then another man, and then my mother. Whereas Tommy wore jeans and an untucked shirt, like he&#x2019;d just been roused from bed by the sound of a lightning strike, my mother wore a silk brocade cocktail dress taken directly from the Kennedy White House, complete with rhinestone earrings and matching bracelet and ring. I recalled seeing a photograph of her mother, Bootsie, wearing the same ensemble.</p><p>My mother turned to me with mild surprise. &#x201c;Vivien, I know I&#x2019;ve told you before that you should never leave the house without lipstick.&#x201d;</p><p>I stared at her for a long moment, wondering if there was more to this altered landscape than just a fallen tree.</p><p>My brother hesitated for a moment, then took a step forward to embrace me. He was ten years older than me, and almost a decade had passed since I&#x2019;d last seen him, but now, at nearly thirty-seven, he still looked like the gangly and awkward boy I&#x2019;d grown up with. Tommy&#x2019;s shirt was soft and worn under my fingers, and I clutched at the familiarity of it. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been a while.&#x201d; He didn&#x2019;t smile.</p><p>My lips trembled as I tried to smirk at his vast understatement, as if we both believed his words could erase nearly nine years of silence. &#x201c;Hello, Tommy.&#x201d; I forced a deep breath into my lungs. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Bootsie?&#x201d;</p><p>His eyes softened, and I knew then that I&#x2019;d lost more than just time in the last nine years. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been gone awhile.&#x201d; His gaze drifted to our mother in her cocktail dress and high heels and something icy cold gripped the area around my heart.</p><p>Before I could say anything, the other man stepped forward. Tripp Montgomery was as tall and slender as I remembered him, short brown hair and hazel eyes that always seemed to see more of the world than the rest of us. He wore khaki pants and a long-sleeved shirt and a tie, which only added to my confusion. I looked at him, wondering why he was there and hoping that somebody would tell me this was all a dream and that I&#x2019;d soon awaken in my bed in the old house with Bootsie kissing my forehead.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; Tripp said, as if he&#x2019;d just delivered me to my front steps after school. As if the earth had somehow stopped spinning in this corner of the world and everything was the same as when I&#x2019;d left it. Except it wasn&#x2019;t.</p><p>&#x201c;Why are you here?&#x201d; I asked, plucking at one of the random questions I needed to ask to make the ground beneath my feet stand still.</p><p>His face remained impassive, but I thought I saw a flicker of what looked like sympathy pass through his eyes. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m the county coroner.&#x201d; He stepped back, allowing my gaze to register the gaping hole in the ground that the intricate root system of the giant cypress had once inhabited.

Beginning with some critical reflections on Louis Althusser&#x2019;s influential writings in the late sixties, Therborn develops a theory of the formation of human subjects. He then goes on to consider the material matrix of ideologies and the problem of ideological change, the ideological constitution of classes and the characteristics of the discursive order that regulates it. Turning to questions of state power and political struggle, Therborn provides a remarkable account of ideological domination that displaces traditional categories, and a fascinating analysis of the process of political mobilization.<br><br>Brief yet wide ranging, probing yet succinct, <i>The Ideology of Power and the Power of Ideology</i>&nbsp;is a work of theoretical exploration that establishes new bearings for the current discussion of ideology.</p><p><b>G�ran Therborn</b> holds the Chair of Sociology at the University of Cambridge, and is editor and author of <i>Inequalities of the World</i>, <i>Asia and Europe in Globalization</i>, <i>Between Sex and Power</i> and <i>From Marxism to Post Marxism?</i>&#x201c;This book represents the most systematic and penetrating exposition of the concept of ideology within the Althusserian framework ...

In the mid-1700s the attentions of both science and poetry sparked a passion for mountains; Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Lord Byron extolled the sublime experiences to be had on high; and by 1924 the death on Mt Everest of an Englishman named George Mallory came to symbolize the heroic ideals of his day. Macfarlane also reflects on fear, risk, and the shattering beauty of ice and snow, the competition and contemplation of the climb, and the strange alternate reality of high altitude, magically enveloping us in the allure of mountains at every level.Robert Macfarlane is an academic at Cambridge University, with a passion for mountaineering. He reviews regularly for The Observer, the TLS and the New Statesman.</p><h2>A History of Modern Lebanon</h2><p>-- A stunning history of Lebanon over five centuries --&#34;Skillfully weaving together social, political, cultural and economic history, this deeply informed and penetrating study provides a rich understanding of the vibrant, tragic, but ever hopeful Leban</p><p><b>Fawwaz Traboulsi</b> is Associate Professor teaching history and politics at the Lebanese American University in Beirut.

Antonio Tabucchi&#39;s writings have been translated into eight languages from Italian and this is the first of several to be published (by Chatto) in the UK.</p><p>As with the ghost at its center, <i>Beloved</i> has taken many forms--from the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel to Oprah Winfrey's decade-in-the-making movie to this challenging audiobook read by Lynn Whitfield. Whitfield, who won an Emmy Award playing the title role in <i>The Josephine Baker Story</i>, has a tough assignment as she guides us back and forth in time with Sethe, an escaped slave who's still shackled by memories of her murdered child. But, as we shift between Sethe's brutal plantation days and her haunted life immediately after the Civil War, we learn one secret after another until, finally, past and present are masterfully reconciled. (Running time: three hours, two cassettes) <i>--Kimberly Heinrichs</i>Toni Morrison--author of Song of Solomon and Tar Baby--is a writer of remarkable powers: her novels, brilliantly acclaimed for their passion, their dazzling language and their lyric and emotional force, combine the unassailable truths of experience and emotion with the vision of legend and imagination. <br>It is the story--set in post-Civil War Ohio--of Sethe, an escaped slave who has risked death in order to wrench herself from a living death; who has lost a husband and buried a child; who has borne the unthinkable and not gone mad: a woman of "iron eyes and backbone to match." Sethe lives in a small house on the edge of town with her daughter, Denver, her mother-in-law, Baby Suggs, and a disturbing, mesmerizing intruder who calls herself Beloved. <br>Sethe works at "beating back the past," but it is alive in all of them. It keeps Denver fearful of straying from the house. It fuels the sadness that has settled into Baby Suggs' "desolated center where the self that was no self made its home." And to Sethe, the past makes itself heard and felt incessantly: in memories that both haunt and soothe her...in the arrival of Paul D ("There was something blessed in his manner. Women saw him and wanted to weep"), one of her fellow slaves on the farm where she had once been kept...in the vivid and painfully cathartic stories she and Paul D tell each other of their years in captivity, of their glimpses of freedom...and, most powerfully, in the apparition of Beloved, whose eyes are expressionless at their deepest point, whose doomed childhood belongs to the hideous logic of slavery and who, as daughter, sister and seductress, has now come from the "place over there" to claim retribution for what shelost and for what was taken from her. <br>Sethe's struggle to keep Beloved from gaining full possession of her present--and to throw off the long, dark legacy of her past--is at the center of this profoundly affecting and startling novel. But its intensity and resonance of feeling, and the boldness of its narrative, lift it beyond its particulars so that it speaks to our experience as an entire nation with a past of both abominable and ennobling circumstance. <br>In Beloved, Toni Morrison has given us a great American novel. <br>Toni Morrison was awarded the 1988 Pulitzer Prize in Literature for Beloved.</p><h2>Arthur C.

Shereel Dupont, a leading contender, has been trained to a fine-tuned perfection by Russell Morgan. At the Ms. Cosmos contest Shereel is confronted by her past as Dorothy Turnipseed--mother, father, sister, two brothers, and a former lover from the backwoods of Georgia. Bawdy humor is generated by the Turnipseed family, and conflict is supplied by Marvella, a big black woman who is Shereel's only real competition. The interplay among the leading characters is propelled with lean prose and dialog to an ending that is as shocking as it is inevitable. Not as powerful or controlled as the author's A Feast of Snakes ( Atheneum, 1987. pap.) or as surrealistic and fascinating as The Knockout Artist (LJ 4/15/88), this is still a taut, readable book that the author's fans will savor.

Special photography reveals the glory of each bulb, explaining flowering size, height, planting depth and requires soil and climatic conditions.<br><br>This gorgeous book, a complete deluxe package, will appeal to gardeners as the world's most authoritative and affordable reference work on bulbs.</p><p>Anna Pavord writes for several magazines in the UK and she has authored eight books, including the internationally acclaimed bestseller, <i>The Tulip</i>.<br>Author Pavord (The Tulip, 1999) has produced a charming, handsome book, the product of a lifetime of keeping notes on her passion, filled with practical advice on the purchase and care of bulbs. The approximately 600 entries include detailed descriptions of the blooms, some comparisons with related cultivars, plant size, hardiness, native areas, and bloom season. Selected species with interesting histories (e.g., hyacinths, tulips, lilies, narcissus) are treated to longer entries. The entries are accompanied by photographs of individual blossoms. These are interspersed with lush two-page-spread images of gardens, masses of blooms, and single spectacular blooms. Pavord&#x2019;s writing style is delightfully conversational while providing important technical information for the gardener. In addition to an introduction about the history, origins, and nature of bulbs, there are a section on how to grow bulbs, a bibliography of outstanding specialist books, and an index. There is one large flaw. The USDA hardiness-zones chart for the 48 contiguous United States, southern Canada, and northern Mexico on the front endpapers has temperatures ranging up to 250 degrees Fahrenheit and 246 degrees Celsius. Somehow 200 degrees was added to the correct temperatures for most of the zones. Purchasers can easily correct the chart, however.

Eve (the name inscribed inside the front cover and then again above the heading for chapter 3) made pencil marks on nearly every paragraph of the book, underlining a phrase, highlighting many passages with strong vertical marks, scratching out some words that she seems to have found superfluous and even x-ing out whole sections that apparently missed their mark with her altogether. Two rusting paper clips isolate several pages, absent any marking at all. Anne Morrow Lindbergh&#39;s lyrical words are still relevant and presage so many of the themes of today&#39;s most popular books: simplicity, peaceful solitude, caring for the soul, a woman finding her place in society and life. I heard that the woman who had lived in the cabin had actually passed away some time before. Thank you, Eve, for your gift... from the sea.n time for the holiday season--in an appropriate and enticing new format, and with a striking new jacket--a spectacular hardcover reissue of one of the most beloved books of our time. Since it was first published in 1955, Gift from the Sea has enlightened and offered solace to readers on subjects from love and marriage to peace and contentment.</p><h2>Deliver Us from Evil: True Cases of Haunted Houses and Demonic Attacks</h2><p><p>Deliver Us from Evil is the first book to introduce demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren and their unique occupation as ghost hunters to the world. The Warrens are known as the original ghost hunters. Together they've been investigating paranormal activity for over fifty-five years throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, Scotland, and Europe, to name only a few places.</p> <p>This book is not entirely about exorcism and many of these stories do not conclude with happy endings. Lorraine describes the existence of supernatural forces and how these supernatural events follow a certain pattern. Ed says it&#x2019;s best described as a book that teaches you about the reality of paranormal or supernatural forces rather than citing an easy route to deliverance. The title of the book is a phrase taken from the Lord's Prayer &#x2013; &#x201c;Lead us not into temptation, but Deliver Us from Evil.&#x201d; The case studies chronicled in this book are a kind of universality of evil spirits, how they operate and what they do.</p> <p>The cases in this book are the first published cases taken from the files of Ed Warren, a demonologist, now deceased, and his wife, Lorraine Warren, an active clairvoyant and medium. These paranormal investigations are filled with tragic possessions, ghostly infestations and demonic obsessions. Ed, who is also an exorcist, does not ignore the potential potency of curses, spells, voodoo dolls, cult ceremonies, demon possession or other invading entities, especially for those who have opened themselves up to supernatural infestation. Although rare, some satanic rituals have led to murder or death.</p> <p>From a psychic researcher&#x2019;s point of view, Lorraine points out how spirits move from infestation, the first stage and signs of ghost and/or spirit haunting (knocking, magic whispering and creeping sounds), the mildest state (shadow ghosts and teleportation of objects), to the more dangerous obsession and finally, the last and worse stage, possession. The only difference between obsession and the last stage, possession, is one of degree. Ed describes these experiences in an entirely no-holds-barred way. If you study these stories and these phenomena carefully, you find that one opens the door to infestation, obsession and possession by careless fixation on the occult, playing with the Ouija board and toying with Satanism or black magic.</p> <p>The most dangerous game and archetypical connection is the Ouija board. According to Ed, "This object, often regarded as a harmless toy, is the way that ordinary people are often lured into making a dangerous connection to the other world." Of the fourteen cases discussed, five are initiated by contact with an Ouija board.</p> <p>The Warrens have tenaciously pursued their careers as ghost hunters for so many years and witnessed people that have been tragically affected by apparitions, ghost whisperings, brutal and unexplained explosions, strange footsteps in the night, uninvited incursions into the privacy of their bedrooms, including various physical attacks. All cases in this book are prior to 1973. Since the first publication, the Warrens have become known worldwide because of supernatural investigations such as West Point Military Academy, the Amityville Horror murder, the Haunting in Connecticut, the Brookfield Demon Murder, Jack and Janet Smurl, Dudley town, Bill Ramsey the Werewolf, and the Enfield Poltergeist, to name a few. Lorraine appears on A&amp;E's Paranormal State TV series.</p></p><p></p><h2>Collision With the Infinite: A Life Beyond the Personal Self</h2><p>--She thought she had gone mad, but she was enlightened and didn't know it! Some people spend years in caves trying to experience what suddenly happened to Suzanne Segal. This is the incredible story of a young woman who irrevocably lost all sense of personal self, or an "I". <p>It is the story of her mind's desperate attempts to come to grips with -- or deny! -- her spiritual condition, a process which took eight years.-- </p><p>Collision with the Infinite is an extraordinary work. One day over twelve years ago, Suzanne Segal, a young American woman living in Paris, stepped onto a city bus and suddenly and unexpectedly found herself egoless, stripped of any sense of a personal self. Struggling with the terror and confusion produced by that cataclysmic experience, for years she tried to make sense of it, seeking the help of therapist after therapist. Eventually, she turned to spiritual teachers, coming at last to understand that this was the egoless state, the Holy Grail of so many spiritual traditions, that elusive consciousness to which so many aspire. </p><p>This book is her story, her own account of what such a terrifying event meant to her when it crashed into her everyday life, and what it means to her now. Her sense of the personal "I" has never returned, and she lives in that heightened spiritual awareness to this day. Stephen Bodian, the former editor of Yoga Journal who wrote the introduction, found her to be "a fearless, joyful being who radiates love and whose spiritual wisdom was equal to that of the masters and sages I most respected." </p><p>Unlike so many spiritual accounts, Collision with the Infinite is written in a completely lucid, nonmystical, straightforward manner, instantly understandable to Westerners and filled with luminous clarity. Nowhere in these pages, in fact, do we have the sense of invasive ego or self-promotion, and Ms. Segal presents us with a remarkable glimpse into "the mystery in which all abides," that egolessness which seekers have pursued since spiritual quests began. </p><p>She thought she had gone mad, but she was enlightened and didn't know it! Some people spend years in caves trying to experience what suddenly happened to Suzanne Segal. This is the incredible story of a young woman who irrevocably lost all sense of personal self, or an "I". </p><p>It is the story of her mind's desperate attempts to come to grips with -- or deny! -- her spiritual condition, a process which took eight years.</p></p><p>FROM CHAPTER FOUR--COLLISION WITH EMPTINESS <p>It was in the springtime that it happened.... The month was May, and the sun felt warm on my head and face as I stood at the bus stop on the Avenue de la Grande Armee. I was in no hurry and had decided to take a bus instead of the metro in order to enjoy the lovely weather. </p><p>Several buses came and went before I finally saw the number 37 approaching down the wide avenue. Six or seven of us were waiting together at the stop, exchanging pleasantries about the weather and comments about the new advertising campaign that had been appearing on all the billboards. As the bus approached, we congregated expectantly near the curb. The bus lumbered to a halt, expelling the acrid odor of exhaust fumes and hot rubber into the warm spring air. </p><p>As I took my place in line, I suddenly felt my ears stop up like they do when the pressure changes inside an airplane as it makes its descent. I felt cut off from the scene before me, as if I were enclosed in a bubble, unable to act in any but the most mechanical manner. I lifted my right foot to step up into the bus and collided head-on with an invisible force that entered my awareness like a silently exploding stick of dynamite, blowing the door of my usual consciousness open and off its hinges, splitting me in two. In the gaping space that appeared, what I had previously called "me" was forcefully pushed out of its usual location inside me into a new location that was approximately a foot behind and to the left of my head. "I" was now behind my body looking out at the world without using the body's eyes. </p><p>From a non-localized position somewhere behind and to the left, I could see my body in front and very far away. All the body's signals seemed to take a longtime to be picked up in this non-localized place, as if they were light coming from a distant star. Terrified, I looked around, wondering if anyone else had noticed something. All the other passengers were calmly taking their seats, and the bus driver was motioning me to put my yellow ticket into the machine so we could be off. </p><p>I shook my head a few times, hoping to rattle my consciousness back into place, but nothing changed. I felt from afar as my fingers fumbled to insert the ticket into the slot and I walked down the aisle to find a seat. I sat down next to an older woman I had been chatting with at the bus stop, and I tried to continue our conversation. My mind had completely ground to a halt in the shock of the abrupt collision with whatever had dislodged my previous reality. </p><p>Although my voice continued speaking coherently, I felt completely disconnected from it. The face of the woman next to me seemed far away, and the air between us seemed foggy, as if filled with a thick, luminous soup. She turned to gaze out the window for a moment, then reached up to pull the cord to signal the driver to let her off at the next stop. When she rose, I slid over to her seat by the window and bid her goodbye with a smile. I could feel sweat rolling down my arms and beading up on my face. I was terrified. </p><p>The bus arrived at my stop on the rue Lecourbe, and I got off. As I walked the three blocks home, I attempted to pull myself back into one piece by focusing on my body and willing myself back into it where I thought I belonged in order to regain the previously normal sensation of seeing through the body&#x2019;s eyes, speaking through the body&#x2019;s mouth, and hearing through the body&#x2019;s ears. The force of will failed miserably. Instead of experiencing through the physical senses, I was now bobbing behind the body like a buoy on the sea. Cut loose from sensory solidity, separated from and witnessing the body from a vast distance, I moved down the street like a cloud of awareness following a body that seemed simultaneously familiar and foreign. There was an incomprehensible attachment to that body, although it no longer felt like "mine." It continued to send out signals of its sensory perceptions, yet how or where those signals were being received was beyond comprehension. </p><p>Incapable of making sense of this state, the mind alternated between racing wildly in an attempt to put "me" back together and shutting down completely, leaving only the empty humming of space reverberating in the ears. The witness was absolutely distinct from the mind, the body, and the emotions, and the position it held, behind and to the left of the head, remained constant. The profound distance between the witness and the mind, body, and emotions seemed to elicit panic in and of itself, due to the sensation of being so tenuously tethered to physical existence. In this witnessing state, physical existence was experienced to be on the verge of dissolution, and it (the physical) responded by summoning an annihilation fear of monumental proportions. </p><p>The thought did arise that perhaps this experience of witnessing was the state of Cosmic Consciousness Maharishi had described long before as the first stage of awakened awareness. But the mind instantly discarded this possibility because it seemed impossible that the hell realm I was inhabiting could have anything to do with Cosmic Consciousness.</p>"'Enlightenment' to me means a total annihilation of the sense of personal doership. In the words of the Buddha, 'Events happen, deeds are done, but there is no individual doer thereof.' "Whether a traumatic experience is necessary for enlightenment to occur is a moot point, but it happened to Suzanne Segal. In her book, she describes the full story in a sincere and lucid manner, in simple words and a fluent style that fascinated me. "To anyone interested in the subject, I would say, 'Read this book!' " -- <i>Ramesh Balsekar, author of Consciousness Speaks</i><br><br>"...Suzanne Segal...writes about her fears and apprehensions while coming to terms with her vivid awakening." -- <i>Rodney Stevens,</i><br><br>"Suzanne Segal's Collision with the Infinite was a major milestone in my life. I consider Segal's book one on the giant works of our time, one of the most intriguing testaments of the mystical state, unique in its own way and language. I carried it around with me for weeks, couldn't bear to put it down, read and re-read it." -- <i>Joseph Chilton Pearce author of The Magical Child</i></p><h2>Thinksheets for Teaching Social Thinking and Related Skills For Teaching Social Skills and Related Skills</h2><p>One of Social Thinking&#39;s best-selling books, Worksheets!, now has a new name: Thinksheets.

He investigates an old mystery of human evolution: why have we evolved positive emotions like gratitude, amusement, awe, and compassion that promote ethical action and are the fabric of cooperative societies?By combining stories of scientific discovery, personal narrative, and Eastern philosophy, Keltner illustrates his discussions with more than fifty photographs of human emotions. <em>Born to Be Good</em> is a profound study of how emotion is the key to living the good life and how the path to happiness goes through human emotions that connect people to one another.60 photographs</p><p>Dacher Keltner is Professor of Psychology and the Director of the Greater Good Science Center at the University of California, Berkeley.

Told in an upbeat, family-friendly style, most information and advice are specific, practical and reinforced with simple exercises and humanizing anecdotes from Readers' Digest surveys. In the Realization chapter, Harrar and DeMaria urge readers to "understand your expectations" and those of their partner, a tricky proposition for which the authors provide a quick exercise and solid tips: "Be realistic about what you do ask for," "Use disappointment as a signal for unconscious expectations" and "Don't compare your spouse to other people's spouses." Unfortunately, some chapters devolve into vague suggestions that smack of filler: "Pull out the music you enjoyed together and dance in the dining room. Go canoeing. Play Scrabble. Wear your sexiest lingerie under a dress when you go out to dinner." This guide will make a helpful addition to a married couple's library, but it lacks the depth to help anyone more than moderately troubled. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

BOMC.</p><p>The Encyclopaedia Britannica has grown and evolved through 15 editions in its 224-year history, each one reflecting the state of knowledge, social mores, and literary style of its age. This pleasurable book is a heavily edited compilation of the more interesting and memorable articles from the distinguished life of the Britannica , in which are recorded both the musings of great minds and the propounding of total misconceptions as verified fact. Occasionally, by way of contrast, articles on the same subject but from different editions are printed together to illustrate the advancement of knowledge or a shift in treatment. Part 1 contains extracts from articles on various topics arranged under broad subject categories, such as Living Things and Technology. Here are found the surprising (bulimia discussed in the 1780s), the amusing (golf is "a certain game among the Scots"), and the simply incorrect (smoking dries the brain into "a little black lump"). Part 2 reprints articles, either whole or in excerpts, by some of the most renowned contributors from Britannica 's past: e.g., Shaw on socialism, Trotsky on Lenin, Freud on psychoanalysis. The editing is somewhat choppy, since this work relies upon materials compiled by two previous editors of the encyclopaedia who also envisioned such a book. This compilation achieves its aim, being both inspiring and amusing while simultaneously humbling the reader with the disconcerting realization that our accumulated knowledge of today may prove to be the entertainment of tomorrow.

COVEY, AUTHOR, <i>THE 7 HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE</i></b></p><h2>M.C. Escher. The Graphic Work</h2><p><p>From impossible staircases to tesselated birds, Dutch artist M.C. Escher (1898&#x2013;1972) crafted a unique graphic language of patterns, puzzles, and mathematics. Dense, complex, and structured by intricate principles, his work is at the same time decorative and playful, toying constantly with optic illusions and the limitations of sensory perception. For mathematicians and scientists, Escher is a mastermind. For hippies, he was the pioneer of psychedelic art.</p><p>Born in Leeuwarden, in the Netherlands in 1898, Escher&#x2019;s early works focused on nature and landscapes, with regular exhibitions in Holland, and some international recognition. It was on a trip to the Alhambra Palace in Spain in the 1920s, however, that Escher found his niche. Sketching the patterns of the palace&#x2019;s Moorish architecture, Escher became captivated by the codependency of forms within and next to each other.</p><p>Working mainly with lithographs and woodcuts, Escher went on to explore the relationships among shapes, figures, and space with a near-obsessive delight. He reveled in quirky vantage points, multiple perspectives, the transition from paper flatness to illusory volume, and intricate mathematical puzzles such as the M�bius strip, a seemingly infinite loop which twists and recoils on itself in a contortion of apparent physical impossibility.</p><p>This introductory book from TASCHEN Basic Art 2.0 taps into Escher&#x2019;s brilliant mind with key works from his restless investigation of image and perception. Along the way, you&#x2019;ll find fish morphing into birds, lizards crawling off the page, masterful reflections, infinite mazes, and some of the most mind-bending images of 20th-century art.</p></p><p></p><h2>Spellbook Cards: Martial (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)</h2><p><b>Hurl Spells Faster than Ever Before with this Invaluable Accessory from Wizards of the Coast and GaleForce 9</b><br><br>The Spellbook cards are an invaluable resource for both players and Dungeon Masters.

His illustrations have been published in more than thirty countries. He lives in London, England.</p>PreSchool-Grade 1&#x2013;Stick Man is happy with his Stick Lady Love and their stick children three&#x2013;until a dog finds him and snatches him for a game of fetch. This is the beginning of a terrible journey during which, Odysseus-like, Stick Man tries to get back but is taken farther and farther away from his home as he is used over the months for everything from a boomerang to a snowman's arm. Readers will feel his anguish and cheer his eventual return (by Santa Claus no less, who rescues him from a fireplace on Christmas Eve) to his loving family. Bouncy, repetitive rhymes make this a good choice for storytime, and the saturated color illustrations carry well (although Stick Man does tend to blend, chameleonlike, into his surroundings). A slightly surreal holiday choice.<i>&#x2013;Eva Mitnick, Los Angeles Public Library</i> END</p><h2>The Self-Taught Programmer: The Definitive Guide to Programming Professionally</h2><p>I am a self-taught programmer. After a year of self-study, I learned to program well enough to land a job as a software engineer II at eBay. Once I got there, I realized I was severely under-prepared. I was overwhelmed by the amount of things I needed to know but hadn&#39;t learned yet. My journey learning to program, and my experience at my first job as a software engineer were the inspiration for this book. This book is not just about learning to program; although you will learn to code. If you want to program professionally, it is not enough to learn to code; that is why, in addition to helping you learn to program, I also cover the rest of the things you need to know to program professionally that classes and books don&#39;t teach you. &#34;The Self-taught Programmer&#34; is a roadmap, a guide to take you from writing your first Python program, to passing your first technical interview. I divided the book into six sections: 1. Learn to program in Python 3 and build your first program. 2. Learn Object-oriented programming and create a powerful Python program to get you hooked. 3. Learn to use tools like Git, Bash, regular expressions and databases. Then use your new coding skills to build a web scraper. 4. Study Computer Science fundamentals including computer architecture, data structures, algorithms and network programming. 5. Learn to program for production: I cover the software development process, testing, and best coding practices.6. Finish with tips for working with a team and landing a programming job.You CAN learn to program professionally. The path is there. Will you take it?</p><p>I spent one year writing <i>The Self-Taught Programmer</i>. It was an exciting and rewarding experience. I treated my book like a software project. After I finished writing it, I created a program to pick out all of the code examples from the book and execute them in Python to make sure all 300+ examples worked properly. Then I wrote software to add line numbers and color to every code example. Finally, I had a group of 200 new programmers "beta read" the book to identify poorly explained concepts and look for any errors my program missed. <b>One last note: this book was written for new programmers. If you are an advanced programmer, this is probably not the best book for you.&nbsp; &nbsp;</b><br>I hope you learn as much reading my book as I did writing it.

Cut Sugar to Trim Fat was first published in 1995, confirmations of the suc- cess and wisdom of this way of eating have continued to be documented in clinical studies, testimonials, and the nutritional literature. Large numbers of doctors all over the country are not only following the Sugar Busters! lifestyle, but recommending it to their patients. Medical studies are proving that high-fiber, low-glycemic diets, like the Sugar Busters! lifestyle recommends, are good for weight control and control of many medical maladies. The low-sugar, low-glycemic, high-fiber diet helps, or in some cases even prevents, problems such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and many others that will be discussed later in this book.<br><br>You may have heard the statistic that obesity has risen as much in the last ten years as in the previous four decades combined. While we can-not prove or disprove these statistics, we do know that obesity is rising so rapidly that it is about to replace smoking as the number-one killer in the United States. Ten years ago, smoking killed 430,000 people a year and obesity killed 325,000 a year. Smoking-related death rates are going down, but obesity-related rates are still climbing.<br><br>Fortunately, both smoking and becoming obese are lifestyle choices. All smokers can quit, and over 90 percent of obese or overweight individuals can better control their weight with just two steps: finding a safe and easy way to accomplish that goal, and giving it a shot. Pounds cannot be &#x201c;thought&#x201d; off. We will tell you how to lose weight and, just as important, how to keep it off. Unlike so many diets that put you through a crash phase or deprivation phase and then an adjusted phase, the Sugar Busters! lifestyle gets you to &#x201c;start out like you can hold out,&#x201d; yes, that you can maintain for the rest of your life. Since you will not be deprived of normal amounts of foods, this will be much easier than you might imagine.<br><br>What is the secret that makes the Sugar Busters! lifestyle so simple, easy, effective, and inexpen- sive? Let us boil all this down to its essence in one sentence: We are recommending that you eat like your ancestors ate (until very recently), because they ate zero refined sugar and only whole-grain and unrefined foods. That is what God and Mother Nature provided. That is the eating plan that got us here. It was a high-fiber, low-glycemic-load diet that contained no refined sugar (see Chapter 10). A little honey was available for the chiefs or royalty, or for those who braved the bees, but not for the general population of the time. Sugar and the sweet tastes of the day came from natural fruits and vegetables.<br><br>What do anthropologists tell us about these ancestors of ours? They tell us that obesity, diabetes, and heart disease appear to have been quite rare.<br><br>Remember that the number-two killer (soon to be number one) at the dawn of the twenty-first century is obesity. What two diseases are strongly associated with obesity? You are right: diabetes and heart disease. To further get you in the mood to absorb the way of eating recommended in this book, think about the following. Dr. Thomas Farley, chair of the Department of Community Health Sciences at Tulane University&#x2019;s School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, recently wrote that in the forty years between 1958 and 1998, the number of Americans diagnosed with diabetes rose 600 percent! Of course, more people are being screened for diabetes today, but the increase in diabetes is still tremendous. According to the government, diabetes alone is costing the United States over $44 billion a year. That is hundreds of dollars apiece for the average taxpayer to treat something that, as you will see, is largely preventable.<br><br>In addition to diabetes, obesity can cause you who are obese and your children the following problems: heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, kidney failure, cancer (colon, breast, and prostate), gallstones, poor circulation (amputations), arthritis, pregnancy complications, men-strual irregularities, stress, incontinence, and depression. Diabetes can also lead to blindness.<br><br>Thirty years ago, following the 1972 Olympics, the country went on a fitness kick, and a larger percent of the population started exercising. This lasted about a decade. In that same decade, we were advised to shift to a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet. We did, and the rate of obesity increased even more! As we will discuss later, when it comes to refined and processed foods, low fat is usually synonymous with high sugar. During the succeeding decades, according to government statistics, the consumption of fat has dropped about 16 percent, while the consumption of calories has remained about the same. Meanwhile, obesity has continued to climb. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, Sixty-five percent of Americans are overweight, and 30.5 percent of us are obese.1 Obesity, not just overweight, is now claiming 15 percent of our children.2<br><br>What have been the most dramatic diet and lifestyle changes in the last thirty to fifty years?<br><br>�&nbsp;Tremendous rise in refined sugar consumption<br><br>�&nbsp;Tremendous rise in low-fat foods (with, in most cases, fats being replaced with added sugars)<br><br>�&nbsp;Tremendous rise in carbohydrate intake as dietary fat and protein were cut<br><br>�&nbsp;Significant decrease in physical activity<br><br>�&nbsp;Tremendous rise in obesity and related illnesses<br><br>�&nbsp;Tremendous rise in diabetes and related illnesses<br><br>�&nbsp;Tremendous rise in individual dollars spent on pills, potions, and treatments<br><br>�&nbsp;An insignificant amount of dollars being spent on prevention<br><br>Hello! Anybody out there? We are astonished that the government and many nutrition professionals continue to recommend high-carbohydrate, low-fat diets. As you read this book, see if you don&#x2019;t believe the Sugar Busters! lifestyle will cure many of these problems without pills or potions and their associated expenses.<br><br>By the way, we do not consider Sugar Busters! a low-carbohydrate lifestyle. It is simply a correct carbohydrate lifestyle. In our earlier fourteen-day meal plan, 40 percent of calories came from carbohydrate, and we have told people that they can probably maintain or even lose weight if they get up to 50 percent of calories from the low-glycemic-index carbohydrates. According to the chairman of the Department of Epidemiology at M. D. Ander- son Hospital, the number one rated cancer research hospital in the United States,3 the high-fiber, low-glycemic-index carbohydrates (like we recommend in our Sugar Busters! books) are those that are high in antioxidants and are exactly what M. D. Anderson recommends that their patients should eat.4<br><br>Since the Sugar Busters! way of eating is roughly 40 percent carbohydrates, 30 percent protein, and 30 percent fat, it is a balanced diet. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, a moderate-fat diet is most likely to be nutritionally adequate because it allows a healthy mix of foods from all food groups.5 This provides a balance that does not require supplements. Sound familiar?<br><br>Besides knowing that our digestive systems developed on a high-fiber, low-glycemic diet over the millennia, what makes the Sugar Busters! lifestyle tick? Controlling, which in this case means lowering, our body&#x2019;s insulin requirement is the key to having our body lean and healthy.<br><br>Today&#x2019;s sugary, highly processed foods cause a rapid rise in blood sugar, which immediately create a big demand for the hormone insulin. Insulin is required to regulate the blood sugar level in your body. It does this by signaling the cells to be receptive to the storage of fats circulating in the blood. Almost any doctor in America will tell you that insulin is known as the &#x201c;fat storage hormone.&#x201d; Accordingly, if you consume foods that do not create this big need for insulin, you don&#x2019;t put the body in a fat storage mode. Neither do you subject the body to other problems caused by too much circulating insulin, as will be described further in Chapter 8.<br><br>If you enjoy eating, this is a good-news book. If you choose to eat out frequently or if your employment requires it, this is a good-news book. If you want your blood chemistry to improve while you continue to eat savory foods, this is a good-news book. If you are diabetic, this is a good-news book. If you want your children to grow up slim and healthy, this is a good-news book. In addition to all these benefits, you will feel and function better in the process. We propose a way of eat-ing that will allow you to eat most foods in normal quantities&#x2014;possibly even in larger quantities than you presently consume.<br><br>You can have three full meals a day and even appropriate snacks. If you want to eat six small meals or snacks, that&#x2019;s fine too. There will be only a few fruits and vegetables, plus products containing added sugars and highly processed grains (flours), that you cannot eat. These are the foods that require the secretion of large amounts of insulin to regulate your blood sugar. By simply avoiding these foods, you can get slimmer and healthier simultaneously.<br><br>There are other books that recommend a much lower percentage of carbohydrate in one&#x2019;s diet. Many miss one of the most important factors in successful, long-term weight loss, which is that only certain carbohydrates cause a dramatic increase in your body&#x2019;s need for insulin. Eliminating most carbohydrates in the diet means missing out on many of the very important vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and other nutrients that our bodies need to function properly.<br><br>Is sugar toxic? Not inherently, but we say that refined sugar in large quanities is certainly toxic to many human bodies, particularly diabetics. An it helps make many people obese. Significant quantites of sugar are also derived in our digestive systems from carbohydrates in general (fruits, vegetables, and grains) but only certain of these sugars cause a strain on the health of our body, probably the mind, and certainly the waistline. Fructose, the sugar in fruit, normally will not hurt you, but eaten at the wrong time or in the wrong combinations, it can create digestive and sometimes metabolic problems. Therefore, what we are recommending is a low-sugar, low-glycemic diet. That cannot be achieved by simply putting away your sugar canister.<br><br>The essence of the Sugar Busters! lifestyle, which will be covered much more thoroughly in succeeding chapters, is that the only things you cannot eat on this diet are the carbohydrates that cause an intense insulin secretion. You must virtually eliminate white potatoes, white rice, bread from highly refined flour, corn products, beets, and of course all refined sugars, such as sucrose (table sugar), corn syrup, molasses, and honey. Also, sugared soft drinks and beer are not allowed. Beyond that, the list of foods allowed on the Sugar Busters! lifestyle is extensive and will delight you by its length and variety.<br><br>Remember that all carbohydrates are broken down to glucose (sugar) in our body, and this raises our blood sugar level. Insulin is then secreted by the pancreas to lower our blood sugar, but too much insulin promotes the storage of fat, elevation of cholesterol levels, and possibly the deposition of plaque in our coronary arteries. Insulin also inhibits the breakdown of previously stored fat. Not fancy, but fact. The charts in Figure 1, page zzz from Williams Textbook of Endocrinology speak to this in a beautifully simple fashion.<br><br>By the way, some people are insulin resistant and require large quantities of insulin to regulate their blood sugar level. We have found nothing good about high average levels of insulin in the body. Insulin not only causes the body to store excess sugar as fat, but inhibits the mobilization of previously stored fat, even if one is on a rather skimpy but high-glucose-generating diet. Insulin also can stimu- late the liver to make more cholesterol.<br><br>Now, you might accept the connection between insulin and overweight, but wonder about the link between insulin and cholesterol. Consider the experience of one of this book&#x2019;s authors.<br><br>After beginning to eat steak, lamb chops, cheese, eggs, and so on for the first time in fifteen years and seeing his cholesterol drop 21 percent and triglycerides drop by 50 percent, he told his doctor (and coauthor) that the only thing that seemed to make sense was that insulin must be causing the liver to make additional cholesterol, because the main difference his low-sugar, low-glycemic diet was causing was a lower daily average level of insulin circulating in his body. Our doctor paused about three seconds and said, &#x201c;You know, you are right! When borderline diabetics get to where they cannot control their diabetes with pills, diet, and exercise, and we have to give them insulin injections, we know the first major side effect will be that their cholesterol will become elevated and as the insulin shots continue, the Type 2 diabetics also will start adding more fatty tissue.&#x201d;<br><br>Our doctor immediately recognized a frequently overlooked connection between insulin and cholesterol. In addition, our endocrinologist and coauthor verified that his Type 2 diabetic patients that require insulin have significantly higher total cholesterol and triglycerides than the average population.<br><br>Although we are in the twenty-first century, few appreciate the insulin-cholesterol connection. Fortunately, more and more are recognizing the link every day. Many of our friends or patients who have gone on our low-glycemic, low-sugar lifestyle have written to us that they had lowered their cholesterol by an average of 15 percent without either exercise or pills. How could they have increased their fat intake and seen their cholesterol, triglyceride, and weight levels fall? It is the effect of lower average levels of insulin in their blood.<br><br>Sound too simple? Well, it really is simple. But it&#x2019;s important to understand why the Sugar Busters! lifestyle works. Once you do, you will be confident it is not another gimmicky diet, which means you will be more likely to follow its guidelines and enjoy the maximum benefits. So please don&#x2019;t just jump to Chapter 9, start the diet, and then not be able to tell anybody why you lost the weight and how you got that spring back in your step. Learn how it works, and you&#x2019;ll better understand the benefits and enjoyment it can bring you for life&#x2014;most probably a longer and healthier life.<br><br>Calories are not the only answer to weight gain or loss. Lavoisier first used the term calorie in the 1840s. Subsequently, in the 20th century, a caloric theory developed that explained weight gain or loss. Although this theory was later declared flawed by the authors, nutritionist ignored this correction.<br><br>We have been misled for decades by peddlers of the calorie-in-calorie-out theory, who either did not know better or had other obvious motives. The scientific data have been available in America for years, waiting for a logical researcher to come to this same conclusion. Americans alone spend $32 billion a year trying to lose weight, an additional $46 billion on medical costs directly related to problems caused by obesity, and $23 billion on time lost while away from th...</p><h2>The New Inductive Study Bible (NASB)</h2><p><p><b>A <i>Simple</i>, <i>Proven</i> Approach to Letting God's Word<br> Change Your Life Forever</b></p><p>Every feature of the Gold Medallion-winning <i>New Inductive Study Bible</i> is designed to help you gain a more intimate understanding of God and His Word.

In the midst of it all, her father lay stretched out on the couch with his face so carved and bloodied that she did not know whether he was alive or dead. &#x201c;I did not notice anything else, I was so frightened and horrified. I ran to the foot of the stairs and called Maggie.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Bridget Sullivan--nicknamed Maggie by Lizzie and her sister--had barely managed to drift to sleep when the shouting woke her. Bridget did not dally an instant. A housemaid had no business stealing a few winks at eleven in the morning, and besides,that scream was too loud, too strident for any ordinary reprimand.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What is the matter?&#x201d; Bridget shouted back.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Come down quick!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Down three flights of stairs Bridget came pounding to find Miss Lizzie Borden in a state such as she&#x2019;d never seen before--backed up against the screen door as though she were about to flee the house entirely.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Go for Dr. Bowen as soon as you can,&#x201d; Lizzie commanded. &#x201c;I think Father is hurt.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Instinctively Bridget moved toward the sitting room to see what was the matter with her employer, Mr. Andrew Borden. &#x201c;Oh, Maggie, don&#x2019;t go in,&#x201d; Lizzie cried. &#x201c;I have got to have a doctor quick. Go over. I have got to have the doctor,&#x201d; she insisted.<br> &nbsp;<br> Bridget dashed across Second Street and &#x201c;rang violently&#x201d; at Dr. Bowen&#x2019;s door, only to have Mrs. Bowen inform her that the�doctor was out making house calls. Back Bridget hurried with the bad news. Lizzie had not budged from the doorway.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Miss Lizzie, where was you?&#x201d; Bridget ventured to ask. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t I leave the screen door hooked?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I was out in the backyard and heard a groan, and came in and the screen door was wide open.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> But Lizzie Borden did not want to answer questions. She wanted help. If she could not have the doctor, she wanted her friend, Miss Alice Russell. &#x201c;Go and get her,&#x201d; she begged. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t be alone in the house.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Bridget yanked her hat and shawl from their hook and took off toward Borden Street.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lizzie Borden waited, alone--as far as anyone knew. There were three locks on the front door. No one intent on harming her father could have gotten in that way. And anyone who might still be lurking inside could not possibly escape without her notice now.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Lizzie, what is the matter?&#x201d; said a voice from behind her. But it was only Mrs. Adelaide Churchill, the young widow next door. On her way home from her marketing she&#x2019;d noticed Bridget crossing the street from Dr. Bowen&#x2019;s house, &#x201c;running, and she looked as if she was scared.&#x201d; Mrs. Churchill went straight home and laid her groceries on a bench in the kitchen. Through her kitchen window she caught a glimpse of Miss Lizzie leaning against the doorway of the back screen, rubbing her face &#x201c;as if she was in great distress.&#x201d; The young woman looked so much out of sorts, Mrs. Churchill had opened her window and called across the fence.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;O, Mrs. Churchill,&#x201d; Lizzie answered, &#x201c;do come over, somebody has killed Father.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> By the time Mrs. Churchill hurried across the yard, Lizzie had sunk down onto the second step, &#x201c;pale and frightened.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;O Lizzie, where is your father?&#x201d; she asked, laying a hand on Lizzie&#x2019;s arm.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;In the sitting room.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mrs. Churchill did not go in. Instead, she asked, &#x201c;Where was you when it happened?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I went to the barn to get a piece of iron.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Where is your mother?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Lizzie said, her words spilling out now, &#x201c;she had a note to go and see someone that was sick this morning, but I don&#x2019;t know but they have killed her too. Father must have had an enemy, for we have all been sick, and we think the milk has been poisoned. Dr. Bowen is not at home, but I must have a doctor.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Shall I go, Lizzie, and try to find someone to go and get a doctor?&#x201d; Mrs. Churchill asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> She answered yes, and Mrs. Churchill ran across the street to L. L. Hall&#x2019;s Stable for help.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lizzie Borden did not want to be alone in that house. She had told Bridget so, and still Bridget had brought her neither the doctor nor Miss Russell. Where could that girl be?<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know but what Mr. Borden is dead&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> It was no more than quarter past eleven when Alice Russell saw the Bordens&#x2019; maid hurrying up her front steps. Right then Alice knew there was trouble. Only last evening herfriend Lizzie had come calling with worrisome news. She and her father and stepmother, Lizzie said, had all been taken sick Tuesday night--very sick indeed.<br> &nbsp;<br> Alice laid aside her work at once and met Bridget at the door.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What is it, Bridget? Are they worse?&#x201d; Alice asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> Bridget did not take time to explain. She hardly knew herself just what had happened. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; the young Irishwoman said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know but what Mr. Borden is dead.&#x201d; She paused only long enough to hear Alice say she would come before taking off again. To Bridget&#x2019;s relief, Dr. Bowen was just stepping from his carriage as she ran back up Second Street.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What is the matter, Lizzie?&#x201d; Dr. Bowen asked as he entered the house.<br> &nbsp;<br> Under any other circumstances, the sight of his familiar face with its graying mustache andside-whiskers might have calmed Lizzie. After all, he had lived across the street from the Bordens for twenty years; she had known him since she was agirl of twelve.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lizzie answered that she was afraid her father had been stabbed or hurt.<br> &nbsp;<br> That one word--stabbed--took him aback. He expected sickness, possibly bad, judging from the way his wife had called out They want you quick over to Mr. Borden&#x2019;s! before he stepped from his carriage. Even poisoning would not have completely surprised him. The previous day, Mrs. Borden had arrived at his office before eight o&#x2019;clock in the morning, nearly hysterical with fear that her family&#x2019;s bread had been tainted. But stabbing?<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Has there been anybody here?&#x201d; Dr. Bowen asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> Not as she knew of, Lizzie answered.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Where is he?&#x201d; the doctor asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lizzie led him through the dining room and motioned toward the sitting room door. Not a sound came from the other side.<br> &nbsp;<br> Steeled for the worst, Dr. Bowen went in.<br> &nbsp;<br><br></p></p><h2>Who Was Nelson Mandela?</h2><p>As a child he dreamt of changing South Africa; as a man he changed the world.&nbsp; Nelson Mandela spent his life battling apartheid and championing a peaceful revolution.&nbsp; He spent twenty-seven years in prison and emerged as the inspiring leader of the new South Africa.&nbsp; He became the country&#x2019;s first black president and went on to live his dream of change.&nbsp; This is an important and exciting addition to the&nbsp;<i>Who Was...?</i>&nbsp;series.</p><p>Pamela Pollack and Meg Belviso have co-authored several children's books, including&nbsp;<i>Who Is J.K.&nbsp;Rowling?</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Who Was Steve Jobs?</i></p><h2>The New York Times Mini Crosswords, Volume 1: 150 Easy Fun-Sized Puzzles</h2><p><p><b>The <i>New York Times</i> Mini Crossword: Available for the first time in print!</b></p><p>Only got a minute of free time?

Even the most seasoned ministers struggle to locate and expel demons. Individuals think they're free from demonic bondage only to be blindsided by another oppressive force.&nbsp;<br><br> But for New York pastor Alexander Pagani, one experience changed everything. He realized how demons lodge themselves in hidden areas of our lives. First, a demon can quite literally reside in an area of the body. Second, demons can live deep in the soul and remain undetected. Deliverance is like a labyrinth with trap doors, backward stairs, and secret rooms.&nbsp;<br><br> In <i>The Secrets to Deliverance</i>&nbsp;Pagani shares biblical strategies and his own experiences for evicting the demons in the "rooms" of your soul and body.

One of the first artists to apply the insights of Freudian psychoanalysis to art, he is celebrated in particular for his surrealist practice, with such conceits as the soft watches or the lobster telephone, now hallmarks of the surrealist enterprise, and of modernism in general.</p><p>Dal� frequently described his paintings as &#x201c;hand-painted dream photographs.&#x201d; Their tantalizing tension and interest resides in the precise rendering of bizarre elements and incongruous arrangements. As Dal� himself explained, he painted with &#x201c;the most imperialist fury of precision,&#x201d; but only &#x201c;to systematize confusion and thus to help discredit completely the world of reality.&#x201d;Revolutionizing the role of the artist, the mustache-twirling Dal� also had the intuition to parade a controversial persona in the public arena and, through printmaking, fashion, advertising, writing, and film, to create work that could be consumed and not just contemplated on a gallery wall.</p><p>This book explores both the painting and the personality of Dal�, introducing his technical skill as well as his provocative compositions and challenging themes of death, decay, and eroticism.</p></p><p>Gilles N�ret (1933&#x2013;2005) was an art historian, journalist, writer, and museum correspondent. He organized several art retrospectives in Japan and founded the SEIBU Museum and the Wildenstein Gallery in Tokyo.

He knew all too well the hardships farm workers faced. His public-relations approach to unionism and aggressive but nonviolent tactics made the farm workers' struggle a moral cause with nationwide support. Along with Dolores Huerta, he cofounded the National Farmworkers Association. His dedication to his work earned him numerous friends and supporters, including Robert Kennedy and Jesse Jackson.</p><p>Dana Meachen Rau has written more than 300 books for children, including picture books, early readers, nonfiction, and biographies.<b>Who Was Cesar Chavez?</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The old theater in Fresno, California, was buzzing with people. A crowd of farmworkers and their families had gathered there for the first meeting of the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA). Cesar Chavez stood on the stage. He was shy, and not a strong public speaker. But his warm smile and friendly manner drew people in to listen. He had started this union&#x2014;a group organized to protect workers&#x2019; rights&#x2014;to help thousands of farmworkers, including many Mexican Americans, who lived in poverty and were treated unfairly in their jobs.<br> &nbsp;<br> This day, September 30, 1962, marked the beginning of more than just the farmworkers&#x2019; union. It was the start of a <i>movement</i>&#x2014;a group of people working together to share an idea and bring about change. Cesar had once worked in the fields himself. He had watched his own family, and many others, suffer to earn enough money to survive. He had a vision for a brighter future for all farmworkers.<br> &nbsp;<br> Many things were decided at the NFWA&#x2019;s first large meeting. Officers were elected and future plans were discussed. Union members unveiled their flag&#x2014;a black eagle in a white circle on a red background. The colors had meaning: black for the hard life of the workers, red for the sacrifices they needed to make, and white for hope.<br> &nbsp;<br> At the meeting, they also agreed on their motto: <i>Viva La Causa!</i> (say: VEE-va la COW-sa) Long Live the Cause!<br> &nbsp;<br> Cesar had worked hard to get the union started, and there was still a long battle ahead. But he was a determined man. He believed in hard work. He believed in sacrificing time and money to help others. He believed in protesting peacefully instead of using violence.<br> &nbsp;<br> Cesar led a movement that brought major changes to the lives of farmworkers. He also changed the way Mexican Americans were viewed in America. With Cesar&#x2019;s guidance, they came together. They demanded attention. America could no longer ignore them.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter 1: The Arizona Ranch</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Cesario Estrada Chavez was born on March 31, 1927. His family lived outside the town of Yuma in the Arizona desert. Mama Tella and Papa Chayo, Cesar&#x2019;s grandparents, had come to the United States from Mexico. They had settled near Yuma in the late eighteen hundreds, bought land, and started a ranch. Papa Chayo died before Cesar was born, but his grandmother still lived in the main adobe house. Cesar, his parents, Librado and Juana, and his brothers and sisters, lived on the ranch, too.<br> &nbsp;<br> Cesar was the second of six children&#x2014;older sister, Rita, and younger siblings Richard, Helena, Vicky, and Lenny. Sadly, Helena died when she was just a baby. At first, the family lived in a room off the main house. They owned only a few pieces of furniture. They had no electricity or running water. When their roof started leaking, the family moved into a cottage on the large ranch.<br> &nbsp;<br> Cesar and his brother Richard spent their time exploring, hiking, and playing outdoors together. They swam in the canal that brought water to the alfalfa, watermelon, grass, and cotton crops that grew in the fields. They liked to ride horses and climb trees. The family gathered for barbecues on summer nights with Cesar&#x2019;s aunts, uncles, and many cousins who lived nearby.<br> &nbsp;<br> But the boys had work to do, too. Cesar&#x2019;s father taught them how to chop wood, work with the horses, weed the crops, and know when the watermelons were ripe. Librado was strict, but patient, as he shared important farming skills with his sons.<br> &nbsp;<br> Cesar&#x2019;s mother, Juana, wanted her children to grow up to be good people. She taught them to share with others without expecting anything in return. And, even though many Mexican boys were raised to be tough, she did not believe in fighting or violence. Cesar remembered one of her sayings throughout his life: &#x201c;It takes two to fight, and one can&#x2019;t do it alone.&#x201d; In other words, even if someone wants to fight you, you have the choice to walk away.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Chavez family was Catholic, but there wasn&#x2019;t a church close by. So Juana and Mama Tella taught the children their religion at home. They gathered around their grandmother&#x2019;s bed at night to hear stories of the saints. The stories of these holy people who had lived very good lives made an impression on young Cesar.<br> &nbsp;<br> Beginning in 1929, many American banks and businesses went out of business. Millions of people lost their jobs and lived in poverty. This was known as the Great Depression. During the Depression, it was very difficult to find work. The Chavez family didn&#x2019;t suffer as much as many others, however. Their hard work on the ranch provided them with food&#x2014;fruit and vegetable crops, fish from the canal, eggs and meat from the chickens, and milk and cheese from the cows.&nbsp;<b> </b>Juana, with her generous heart, even invited less fortunate people over for meals.<br> &nbsp;<br> When Cesar was six, he was old enough to attend school. But when he arrived at the schoolhouse, the teacher wouldn&#x2019;t let Cesar sit next to his sister, Rita. She asked him to sit with the other children in first grade. He cried and insisted that he have a seat next to Rita. The teacher finally gave in. After a few days, Cesar felt ready to sit with his other first-grade classmates.<br> &nbsp;<br> But Cesar never really liked school. He would have much rather been outside on the ranch where he wasn&#x2019;t forced to wear shoes! At school, he also discovered how unkind some white people acted toward Mexican Americans. Cesar&#x2019;s classmates made fun of his brown skin and called him &#x201c;dirty.&#x201d; They tried to start fights with him. Cesar always spoke Spanish at home with his family. But his teacher hit him on the knuckles with a ruler if she heard him speaking Spanish in the classroom.<br> &nbsp;<br> At the time, more than 1.5 million Mexicans lived in the United States. Many had come in the early nineteen hundreds, looking for work&#x2014;and there had been plenty of jobs. But during the Depression, jobs were scarce, and many white people blamed Mexicans. Some were <i>deported</i>, or sent back, to Mexico&#x2014;even if they were American citizens! Those who stayed faced racism in their communities.<br> &nbsp;<br> Even though the Chavez family was luckier than many during the Depression, by 1933 the ranch itself was in trouble. Arizona suffered from a drought. It had not rained for a long time. The canal was dry and the earth in the fields was cracked. No crops would grow. The family could not pay its bills.<br> &nbsp;<br> Hundreds of thousands of other Americans who had lost their jobs headed to California to find work. California was suffering from the Great Depression, too. But there was no drought in California. And because the state has some of the richest farmland in the world, workers were needed to pick crops, which included tomatoes, lettuce, grapes, avocados, strawberries, peas, cherries, and corn. So in 1938, Cesar&#x2019;s father headed west to California. He hoped to earn enough money to support his family and save the ranch.</p><h2>French Vocabulary</h2><p><p>Packed with useful information for beginners of all ages. <br><br></p> <p></p></p><p></p><h2>Ricky Sticky Fingers</h2><p><p>Meet Ricky!

Mariotti describes the characteristics of the successful entrepreneur and covers the nuts and bolts of getting a business up, running and successful.</p><p><b>Steve Mariotti</b> is the founder of the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship (NFTE), a non-profit organization that has taught over twenty-five thousand young people across the country how to start their own small businesses.<b>The Difference Between an Entrepreneur and an Employee</b><br>Many people dream of owning their own business, being their own boss, and enjoying the reward of unlimited earnings. Entrepreneurship is the American dream. But most people hesitate to take the plunge. Like them, you may worry that you don't have enough money, time, or experience to start and operate your own small business.<br><br>Michelle insists that there is always time to start your own business, even if you're a single mother and a full-time college student. Michelle should know; at age nineteen, she started her own business while attending college and caring for her daughters -- Angela, three years old, and Erica, age eighteen months -- and her newborn son, Kristian. Before she started her clothing resale company, � La Mode, Michelle knew nothing about running a business and had very little money. When I met Michelle, I thought she had tremendous natural elegance and poise, but it was clear that she was living a difficult life as a single mother of three children. Today, she's a successful entrepreneur.<br><br>Like Michelle, most Americans earn money by working in business. Business is the buying and selling of products and services in order to make money. Someone who earns a living by working for someone else's business is an employee of that business.<br><br>There are many different kinds of employees. At Ford Motor Company, for instance, some employees build the vehicles, some sell them, and some manage the company. But they all have one thing in common -- they do not own the business, they work for others who do.<br><br>Entrepreneurs, in contrast, are both owners and employees. An entrepreneur is responsible for the success or failure of his or her business.<br><br><b>Sell Something for More Than It Costs You to Buy (or Make) It</b><br>Michelle loved fashionable clothes, but she lived in New Bedford, Massachusetts. The stores in New Bedford didn't always sell the latest fashions, and, when they did, they charged high prices. During an entrepreneurship class conducted by the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship, Inc. (NFTE), Michelle took a trip to Manhattan's wholesale clothing district. This visit gave Michelle her business idea. A wholesaler is a business that purchases products in bulk from the manufacturer and sells smaller quantities to retailers. Retailers buy small quantities from wholesalers and sell single items to customers. At each step along the road from the manufacturer to the customer, the price of the product increases.<br><br>Michelle was surprised that wholesale prices were much lower than the prices of clothing in stores. Michelle knew there were, in her hometown, many young women like herself who would love to buy the latest fashions at reasonable prices. During her visit to the wholesale district, Michelle learned that all she needed to do to be able to buy from a wholesaler was to apply for a sales tax identification number. Anyone can apply for a sales tax number by calling the state sales tax office and requesting an application for a sales tax number. After the application is filled out and returned, the number will be assigned.<br><br>Michelle decided to buy clothes wholesale and sell them for higher prices to her neighbors. She invited a dozen friends to her house for a clothes-buying party. If she sold them out of her home, Michelle reasoned, she could offer the latest styles at lower prices than the stores in her town were charging. Michelle had stumbled on the key to business success: Buy (or make) something for less than someone else is willing to pay to buy it from you! Before she visited the wholesale district again, she collected size information from her twelve friends and asked them whether they had any special requests. Michelle's customers are happy to pay the difference between the wholesale cost and the prices she charges. They know they are getting a great value.<br><br>Today, Michelle visits the wholesale district once a month and buys several hundred dollars' worth of clothes. There are many wholesalers in Manhattan, but Michelle has developed good relationships with a few whose products she really likes.<br><br>Michelle was afraid she would have to buy bulk quantities in order to get the wholesalers to sell to her, but she found that most of them are comfortable selling her as few as two or three items. They like dealing with Michelle because she doesn't ask for credit. She pays in full when she makes her purchases.<br><br>Michelle resells the clothes for around twice the wholesale price she paid. Sales are made from her home or on visits to customers' houses. Michelle's friends and neighbors are delighted to have a less expensive alternative to the local mall. Her customers also enjoy shopping in a more intimate setting.<br><br>As Michelle says, "Who would ever think a teenage mother with three children could ever own her own business and graduate from college?" After she finishes college, Michelle plans to open her own clothing boutique. She hopes her success will spark a revival of small businesses in her community.<br><br><b>Keystoning</b><br>In her entrepreneurship class, Michelle learned about keystoning -- buying a product wholesale and then selling it for double the wholesale price. For a simple business, keystoning is a good rule of thumb for covering your costs and making a nice profit. Like Michelle, many young entrepreneurs buy products such as lingerie, cologne, or watches from a wholesaler. You might buy T-shirts from a wholesaler for $3 each, for example, and sell each shirt to your customers for $6.<br></p><h2>Brave Girls Bible Stories</h2><p><p><b>An exciting new brand and storybook to help girls grow into brave, confident daughters of the King.</b></p><p>Young girls will grow in their knowledge of the Bible and in their faith by getting to know our Brave Girls&#x2015;Hope, Gracie, Glory, Faith, and Honor&#x2015;five modern-day friends who relate to today&#x2019;s readers!

Twelve-year-old Zane has not known many family members other than his mother; after she makes contact with his deceased father's grandmother, Zane travels to the oppressively humid city. When New Orleans is placed under a mandatory evacuation, Zane and his great-grandmother leave with his dog, Bandy, and her pastor; when Bandy is spooked by growling Dobermans, he leaps from the car, followed by Zane. Zane and Bandy endure the hurricane's landfall and the failure of the levees at his great-grandmother's house until they meet a young girl, Malvina, and her guardian, Tru. The trio canoes through the snake-infested waters seeking assistance. Arriving in a neighborhood protected by privately hired security forces leads to vicious threats from the armed guards, who are loading helicopters stuffed with rugs and other expensive items. After their canoe is stolen, they head to the chaos of the Superdome and eventually to a bridge connecting the city to Algiers, in which they hope to find Tru's cousin. Vivid descriptions of the toxic waters, the commotion at the Superdome, and racial tension are handled factually yet sensitively.

As she grew into adulthood and became a mother, baking took a temporary back burner. Then in 2008, her daughter Jenny passed away from SIDS. She was beyond devastated. With no hope in sight, her friends invited her to church, and she started to bake again. Ten years later, her Instagram account has more than 100,000 followers, she has taught numerous classes and appears on national television to showcase her popular techniques, and she has found a beautiful way to honor her daughter Jenny and make her family proud.

He developed the <i>Improve Your Math Fluency</i> series of workbooks to help students become more fluent in basic math skills.<br><br><b>WHAT TO EXPECT</b>: This is a workbook designed to offer plenty of practice with essential skills. It is not a textbook designed to <i>teach</i> trigonometry, but a workbook designed to supplement a student&#x2019;s instruction in trigonometry. Examples and a brief description of the concepts are included to serve as a quick refresher and a guide. If you need more instruction, you should use this workbook in combination with a textbook. The last chapter involves applications of trig identities, which is a challenging topic that will mostly interest more advanced students. A few chapters are intended to help students memorize the trig functions of common angles like 30, 150, or 315 degrees, which will be especially useful for students who may take exams without a calculator (that&#x2019;s the case with the MCAT and many math and science courses). There may be more practice than many students need, which is much better than having too little practice. Any extra pages may be helpful for teachers or parents with multiple children.<br><br><b>DESCRIPTION</b>: This <i>Trigonometry Essentials Practice Workbook with Answers</i> provides ample practice for developing fluency in very fundamental trigonometry skills. Every problem can be answered without a calculator, which is very helpful for students who aren&#x2019;t allowed to use a calculator. This is the case in some trig and physics courses, as well as some standardized exams (like the MCAT).<br><br><b>CONTENTS</b>: This workbook is conveniently divided up into 11 chapters so that students can focus on one trigonometry skill at a time. Skills include the following:<br><ul><li>converting between degrees and radians;</li><li>expressing sine, cosine, tangent, secant, cosecant, and cotangent as fractions by looking at right triangles;</li><li>solving for unknown sides and angles in 45�-45�-90� and 30�-60�-90� right triangles;</li><li>determining the sine, cosine, tangent, secant, cosecant, and cotangent of multiples of 30� and 45� up to 360� (working with both degrees and radians);</li><li>practice finding the reference angle for angles in Quadrants II, III, and IV;</li><li>finding the inverse trig functions;</li><li>applying the law of sines and the law of cosines to solve for unknown sides and angles in acute and obtuse triangles;</li><li>solving problems with trig identities (like the angle sum and difference formulas);</li><li>and solving algebraic equations that feature basic trig functions.</li></ul><br><b>EXAMPLES</b>: Each section begins with a few pages of instructions for how to solve the problems followed by some examples. These examples should serve as a useful guide until students are able to solve the problems independently.<br><br><b>ANSWERS</b>: Answers to exercises are tabulated at the back of the book. This helps students develop confidence and ensures that students practice correct techniques, rather than practice making mistakes.<br><br><b>PHOTOCOPIES</b>: The copyright notice permits parents/teachers who purchase one copy or borrow one copy from a library to make photocopies for their own children/students only. This is very convenient if you have multiple children/students or if a child/student needs additional practice.<br><br><b>INTRODUCTION</b>: An introduction describes how parents and teachers can help students make the most of this workbook. Students are encouraged to time and score each page. In this way, they can try to have fun improving on their records, which can help lend them confidence in their math skills.<br></p><p><b>THE IMPROVE YOUR MATH FLUENCY SERIES OF WORKBOOKS</b><br>Chris McMullen, Ph.D.<br><br>This series of math workbooks is geared toward practicing essential math skills.

While juices did their job of providing me with good nutrients that are essential for the body, and while juices are good for easy absorption of the nutrients, they do not contain the fiber from the fruit or the vegetable, and I found that I wanted something more substantial and nutritious, but also easy and rapid to prepare.<br> &nbsp;<br> So, I decided that smoothies would be the answer; but not just any smoothie but smoothies made from the Nutribullet. I bought a Nutribullet and it does the job for me. One of the best things I liked about this blender is that it is compact and does not occupy much space, making it ideal for my kitchen; which is small and compact. Making smoothies with the Nutribullet is a quick and simple feat. What about washing the Nutribullet after I'm all done? It can be done in a jiffy, with no pulp or mess to deal with. Pretty sleek, don't you think?<br> &nbsp;<br> I simply love the Nutribullet, for it allows me to whip a healthy breakfast, packed full of nutrition, in a very short time. Washing the cup and blade is equally simple and fast and there is no waste as there is when juicing fruits and vegetables.I am a registered nurse, working with patients with long term conditions.

Michael lives in Toronto, Ontario.</p>Grade 6&#x2013;9&#x2014;Similar to PBS's <i>History Detectives</i>, this book explains how historians have collaborated with experts in various fields (medicine, space, archaeology, meteorology, etc.) to resolve disappearances that have long puzzled them. Each chapter discusses one mystery, beginning with historical background. The modern scientific processes used to help solve it are then discussed, followed by the often-fascinating conclusion that was drawn. Famous bodies (Anastasia Romanov and George Mallory) have been identified, a lost city (Ubar) has been found, and mysterious journeys (Hsu Fu's, the <i>Star Dust</i>, and the INS <i>Dakar</i>) have been mapped. Several of the subjects (Hatshepsut, the Anasazi, John Franklin, and George Mallory) are covered in multiple books for this age range, but others are not as easily found. The writing is clear and engaging. The full-color illustrations are a mix of photographs, maps, and flat, animation-style art. Each chapter ends with a conclusion, but also poses a question that still remains to be solved. The book contains a glossary and an extensive index, but no notes or other bibliographic information. Students doing reports or historically minded browsers are the audience for this book. It's not an essential purchase, but it is an interesting one.&#x2014;<i>Lisa Crandall, formerly at Capital Area District Library, Holt, MI</i> <br>(c) Copyright 2011. &nbsp;Library Journals LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Media Source, Inc.

PreSchool-Grade 2&#x2014;Otis is a fun-loving tractor who roams the fields after a hard day's work and plays in the haystacks. In the barn one night, his engine provides a gentle purr that helps a frightened young calf fall into a peaceful sleep. The two become inseparable. That is, until the farmer decides to upgrade and brings home a brand-new, shiny yellow tractor and relegates Otis to the weeds behind the building. Having outlived his usefulness, Otis just sits there, impervious to the calf's call to play. But when his friend gets stuck in Mud Pond and no one&#x2014;not even the fire department&#x2014;can pull her out, the feisty tractor revs his engine ("putt puff puttedy chuff") and saves the day. His heroism and concern for a friend are themes that will appeal to young readers. Long's gouache and pencil artwork is stunning with a red and cream main character against a sepia-toned monochromatic background. The overall effect is nostalgic and comforting as readers bond with the determined little tractor. In the end, Otis finds a place on the farm where his engine's soft purr can be put to good use. This satisfying conclusion that speaks of a place for everyone is sure to ring true to children.&#x2014;<i>Joan Kindig, James Madison University, Harrisonburg, VA</i> END</p><h2>The Girl with the Silver Eyes</h2><p><b>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s something strange about that kid.&#x201d; At least that&#x2019;s what everyone says, but they don&#x2019;t know the truth.

There was no yard, except for a narrow strip of grass between the parking lot and the street. Nowhere to play. Her mother had been concerned about that, for though there was a park two blocks away, she did not want Katie to go there alone.<br> <br>So for the moment she sat on the balcony, looking through the iron bars that formed the sides of it, and watched the activity in the street.<br> <br>Katie had always lived in the country, and she had liked that. This seemed interesting, however, and it was a nice street. It was wide and shaded with big trees, and most of the time there wasn&#x2019;t a lot of traffic. Except when people were going to work, of course, the way they were now.<br> <br>She saw Miss Katzenburger emerge from the front door below and head toward the street. Katie hadn&#x2019;t met her yet, but she knew who she was. She&#x2019;d seen which apartment she went into&#x2014;3-B, one floor up&#x2014;and had looked at the nameplate beside the door.<br> <br>Miss Katzenburger had red hair and was quite pretty. Katie admired pretty people, like Miss Katzenburger and her mother; she wasn&#x2019;t pretty herself. Even if she hadn&#x2019;t had to wear horn-rimmed glasses, she knew that her face was plain. Her hair was an ordinary color, a sort of pale tan that was not quite blonde and not quite brown, and as straight as it was possible for hair to be. When she grew old enough to have a choice, she thought she might like to be redheaded, like Miss K. Or, her second choice, blonde like her mother.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, Joy, wait a minute!&#x201d;<br> <br>Katie pressed her face against the cold bars to see who was calling after Miss K. Oh, him.<br> <br>She had met Mr. Pollard. He lived in 3-A, right across from Miss K., and she&#x2019;d collided with him on the stairs last night, her first whole day at The Cedars Apartments. He had dropped some papers he was carrying, and Katie had stepped on them, after which he had sworn at her. And then, when she had said nothing except, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; and stared at him, Mr. Pollard quickly snatched up his papers and edged around her, almost running the rest of the way down.<br> <br>The way people often ran away from her, Katie thought. She&#x2019;d wondered if it would be different in the city from the way it had been at home, near Delaney. Oh, they didn&#x2019;t always run, exactly, but when they looked into her face they often backed away, muttering things she couldn&#x2019;t understand, and hurried in some other direction.<br> <br>Mr. Pollard, who was nearly bald on top even though he wasn&#x2019;t very old yet, didn&#x2019;t see her now. He caught up with Miss K., and their voices carried clearly to the little balcony over their heads.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid I&#x2019;ve missed my bus; could you give me a lift?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; Miss K. agreed. She had a nice voice. &#x201c;I have to pick up my girl friend, Angie, on the way.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s OK. Just so I get downtown. I had to stay up for hours last night, redoing all those papers that brat walked on, and I overslept.&#x201d;<br> <br>Katie tightened her fingers on the bars. It had been just as much his fault as hers that they&#x2019;d run into each other; he had been running, too. Why were so many things her fault?<br> <br>They had stopped, just a few yards out from the front edge of the balcony; she could see the tops of their heads, one a beautiful mass of red-gold curls, the other with a few strands of hair combed across the bald spot.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait a minute, have I got my keys?&#x201d; Miss K. dug around in her handbag. &#x201c;What brat are you talking about? The little girl in 2-A? I thought she looked like a cute little owl, with those glasses. The quiet type. I doubt if she&#x2019;ll be any trouble. Oh, here they are!&#x201d;<br> <br>Miss K. held the keys up, jingling them. Katie always thought of people by their initials; it was easier, especially when they had names like Katzenburger. Mr. P. shifted his briefcase to the other hand. &#x201c;Did you look at her? At her eyes?&#x201d;<br> <br>Miss K. stopped jingling the keys. &#x201c;No. What about them?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re silver. And they&#x2019;re weird, she&#x2019;s a weird kid.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Silver eyes?&#x201d; Miss K. looked at him more closely. &#x201c;Mr. Pollard, you haven&#x2019;t been drinking, have you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course not! Look at the kid the next time you see her&#x2014;she&#x2019;s got funny eyes, I tell you! And I thought you were going to call me Hal.&#x201d;<br> <br>They started walking toward the cars in the parking area. Miss K. owned a light blue Pinto; Katie had seen her get out of it yesterday afternoon.<br> <br>They were almost there when Mr. P. gave a howl of mingled pain and rage, and doubled over, grabbing for his ankle. Then he turned and looked back toward the building.<br> <br>His eyes met Katie&#x2019;s, and there was fear and anger in them. He swore again, loudly enough so she could hear it. &#x201c;I told you, there&#x2019;s something strange about that kid. I nearly broke my ankle.&#x201d;<br> <br>Miss K. stared at him in amazement. &#x201c;Well, I can see that, but what did she have to do with it? You tripped over a rock!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah! Yeah, I got hit in the ankle by a rock that wasn&#x2019;t there a few minutes ago. It just sort of . . . sort of slid right out in the middle of the sidewalk and smacked me!&#x201d;<br> <br>He was still glaring at Katie as he rubbed at his injured ankle, hopping on one leg, then balancing himself against a light post.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, for heaven&#x2019;s sake! You can&#x2019;t possibly be blaming a child for that?&#x201d; Miss K. unlocked the car door and regarded him in exasperation.<br> <br>&#x201c;There wasn&#x2019;t any rock on the sidewalk a minute ago, was there? Did you see it, a minute ago? Did you ever see a rock on the sidewalk before?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, no,&#x201d; Miss K. admitted. &#x201c;But they&#x2019;re all around the edges of the flower beds; something must have knocked one loose.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Mr. P. demanded. &#x201c;What was near it? It moved just now, just in time to connect with my ankle bone! And she&#x2019;s up there, watching us.&#x201d;<br> <br>Miss K. lifted her gaze to the second floor balcony. For a moment their eyes locked over the distance between them. Katie&#x2019;s face didn&#x2019;t change expression. She could see Miss K. thinking it over, and then she said, &#x201c;She&#x2019;s only a cute little girl.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Cute? Are we talking about the same kid?&#x201d; Mr. P. turned and stared at her too, angry and baffled. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how she does it, but there&#x2019;s something about her.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, if you want a ride with me, come on,&#x201d; Miss K. said, and they got into the Pinto and drove away.<br> <br>Katie sat watching two men from the apartment house across the street, men who didn&#x2019;t pay any attention to her. And then she remembered the rock that was still in the middle of the sidewalk, and she stared at it, very hard, until it began to move. It slid slowly at first, and then, as Katie&#x2019;s power built up with increased effort, it spurted off the rest of the way and lodged somewhat crookedly in the edge of the flowerbed.<br> <br><br> <br>Katie had known, long before she learned that by thinking about moving things she could actually move them, that she was different from other kids. She knew it partly because the adults around her said so.<br> <br>She had lived with her mother and father until she was nearly four, and she remembered that, though they had both been kind and affectionate, they had sometimes been puzzled by her behavior.<br> <br>&#x201c;She never cries!&#x201d; Monica Welker had said, on more than one occasion, when Katie was listening. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t want a fussy baby, but even when she was only an infant, she never cried! At first I was terrified that there was something wrong with her&#x2014;mentally, I mean. It wasn&#x2019;t long before we could see that wasn&#x2019;t so&#x2014;and then she went almost too far the other way. I mean, Katie&#x2019;s so bright that sometimes she frightens me!&#x201d;<br> <br>Katie, considering that, thought Monica rather confused. First she was afraid her baby was retarded, and then was equally afraid because she was intelligent.<br> <br>She had, when she was little, called her parents Mama and Daddy. But now Monica didn&#x2019;t seem like her mother at all. Her parents had gotten a divorce when she was three, almost four years old, and her mother had gone to work and couldn&#x2019;t keep her, so she&#x2019;d gone to live with Daddy and Grandma Welker. But then Daddy had gone away to work somewhere else, and she had lived with just Grandma; and Grandma, too, thought she was peculiar. While she lived with Grandma, Monica had come to see her sometimes, but it was clear Katie made her nervous.<br> <br>Of course, part of that, Katie realized, was her own fault. When she knew that some of the things she did were things no other kid she&#x2019;d ever met could do, maybe she should have stopped doing them. At least where other people could know about them, anyway. But it was like having an itch and not scratching it. When she wanted to move something, the compulsion was too strong to resist; usually, she&#x2019;d already done it by the time she thought about the consequences.<br> <br>Like the time her grandma had hurt her leg and was muttering about not wanting to leave her Social Security check in the mailbox for fear those nasty Johnson boys would steal it on their way home from school. They often went along peeking into everyone&#x2019;s boxes to see what was there, and more than once they&#x2019;d scattered mail in the ditches beside the road.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think I can walk that far,&#x201d; Grandma Welker had said, rubbing at the knee she&#x2019;d twisted when she slipped on the cellar steps.<br> <br>&#x201c;I could go get the check,&#x201d; Katie offered.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, no. I don&#x2019;t want you to go out there alone in this bad weather. You know what happened the last time.&#x201d;<br> <br>The last time a man had stopped and asked her if she wanted a ride. He was a perfectly nice man, Katie knew he was, and she hadn&#x2019;t gotten into the car, and the man had simply smiled and driven away. Katie had tried to explain that it was only that he thought she was a long way from home, and it was cold and raining, and he was kind. But Grandma Welker was convinced he was a child molester.<br> <br>Katie was a little vague about what child molesters actually did. But she knew it was something unpleasant, and she had sense enough not to get into a car or walk away with a stranger, for heaven&#x2019;s sake. Grownups told you and told you things, and then they acted as if you didn&#x2019;t have any brains at all, even when they admitted you were bright.<br> <br>So, not wanting to upset her grandma, Katie had said no more. But when the old woman was busy peeling potatoes for supper, Katie sat in the window seat in the dining room and concentrated on the mailbox. The door of it stuck, and for a few minutes she thought it wasn&#x2019;t going to come open. But then it did, and she lifted the tan envelope that the government check always came in, wafted it noiselessly through the air, opened the door, brought it in, and deposited it on the dining room table.<br> <br>Grandma Welker found it when she came in to set the table. She let out a sort of yelp, like old Dusty when someone rocked on his tail, and almost dropped the plates she was carrying.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where did that come from?&#x201d; she demanded.<br> <br>Katie turned from the window seat, pulling her short skirt down over her knees to cover the scabs. &#x201c;What?&#x201d; she asked innocently.<br> <br>&#x201c;My check! My Social Security check!&#x201d;<br> <br>Katie simply stared at her blankly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did the mailman bring it up to the house?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He must have,&#x201d; Katie decided, seeing an easy way out. Only her grandma couldn&#x2019;t leave it at that.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did he give it to you? Did he knock on the door?&#x201d;<br> <br>Katie stared. She knew it bothered the adults around her, the way she could keep her small face perfectly expressionless, yet it seemed the safest thing to do most of the time.<br> <br>After a moment, her grandma gave up and took the check away, muttering under her breath.<br> <br>Maybe, Katie thought, it would have been better to risk having the Johnson boys steal it than to have saved her grandma the walk to the mailbox.<br> <br>It had taken her a while to learn to be careful about what she moved. She knew the name for the moving, now; she&#x2019;d read it in a book. Telekinesis. That meant that she was able to move objects from one place to another without touching them. At first she hadn&#x2019;t realized that she was the only one who could do it. But when people got upset or excited about it, it didn&#x2019;t take her long to catch on.<br> <br>There had been a time when Grandma Welker had been busy in the kitchen and had spoken to Katie over her shoulder. &#x201c;I need a clean hanky. Be a good girl; run upstairs and get me one out of my top bureau drawer.&#x201d;<br> <br>And Katie, who was curled in the rocking chair munching on an apple and reading Call of the Wild, paused long enough to slide open the bureau drawer, mentally search out the handkerchief, and waft the square of linen down the stairs and into Grandma&#x2019;s apron pocket.<br> <br>&#x201c;Katie! Did you hear what I said? Run upstairs&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a hanky in your pocket,&#x201d; Katie said, spitting out a seed and looking up long enough to see the amazement creep over her grandma&#x2019;s face when she felt in the apron pocket.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why, I declare, there wasn&#x2019;t one there a minute ago . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>She looked suspiciously at Katie, who was again engrossed in her book.<br> <br>&#x201c;I could see the edge of it sticking out,&#x201d; Katie said. Grandma Welker said no more, but the suspicion remained, unspoken.<br> <br>As time went on, this peculiar ability of Katie&#x2019;s made more and more problems between them. When Katie learned how to turn off the light from the wall switch after she&#x2019;d gotten into bed and turn the pages of her book without touching them (she didn&#x2019;t mean to do that when someone was watching her, but sometimes she forgot) and smooth her hair without using the hair brush, she made Grandma Welker nervous.<br> <br>Grandma stopped taking her to church after the time the pages of Pastor Grooten&#x2019;s sermon got all mixed up, although Katie hadn&#x2019;t actually had anything to do with that. A breeze had come in the open window (it was a very hot day), and the pages had slithered off onto the floor, and when he picked them up they were out of order.<br> <br>Of course, she had been responsible when Pastor Grooten&#x2019;s hair stood on end and seemed to do an odd little dance. It had been a long, boring sermon, and Katie, unable to keep her mind on it, had started entertaining herself. She hadn&#x2019;t thought anyone would notice. She&#x2019;d also stirred up air currents carrying pollen from a nearby field of ragweed, and people in the congregation had begun to grab for their handkerchiefs.<br> <br>Pastor Grooten was the sort of preacher who didn&#x2019;t appreciate crying babies during his sermons, nor coughing and sneezing. He had paused and looked down on his flock, frowning. How could all those people suddenly have to sneeze at the same time?<br> <br>Just for the fun of it, Katie had shifted the air current then so that the pollen drifted under his own nose; and when he sneezed, Pastor Grooten had to grab for his sermon pages before they sailed off the lecturn. But they didn&#x2019;t actually slide until the next Sunday. On that day Katie remembered how suspicious her grandma had been about Pastor&#x2019;s hair standing on end the Sunday before (after the windows had been closed by one of the deacons). It all came to a head after the service when Grandma had said Katie could stay with old Mrs. Tanner, down the road, instead of going to church. Mrs. Tanner was bedridden, and Katie could read to her for an hour and a half a week, on Sunday mornings.<br> <br>Katie didn&#x2019;t mind. She read very well&#x2014;she had taugh...</p><h2>How to Be a Fashion Designer (Careers for Kids)</h2><p><i>"Highly recommended for any aspiring fashionistas." &#x2013;&nbsp;School Library Journal</i><b><br><br>Design, style, and accessorize clothes with this fun guide full of practical fashion design ideas for kids!</b><br><br>Draw and color creations, choose materials, and learn to design through drawing your own fashion.

After so many months of preparation, the work was finally complete: The motor and blades were bolted and secured, the chain was taut and heavy with grease, and the tower stood steady on its legs. The muscles in my back and arms had grown as hard as green fruit from all the pulling and lifting. And although I&#x2019;d barely slept the night before, I&#x2019;d never felt so awake. My invention was complete. It appeared exactly as I&#x2019;d seen it in my dreams.</p><p>News of my work had spread far and wide, and now people began to arrive. The traders in the market had watched it rise from a distance and they&#x2019;d closed up their shops, while the truck drivers left their vehicles on the road. They&#x2019;d crossed the valley toward my home, and now they gathered under the machine, looking up in wonder. I recognized their faces. These same men had teased me from the beginning, and still they whispered, even laughed.</p><p><i>Let them, </i>I thought. It was time.</p><p>I pulled myself onto the tower&#x2019;s first rung and began to climb. The soft wood groaned under my weight as I reached the top, where I stood level with my creation. Its steel bones were welded and bent, and its plastic arms were blackened from fire.</p><p>I admired its other pieces: the bottle-cap washers, rusted tractor parts, and the old bicycle frame. Each one told its own story of discovery. Each piece had been lost and then found in a time of fear and hunger and pain. Together now, we were all being reborn.</p><p>In one hand I clutched a small reed that held a tiny lightbulb. I now connected it to a pair of wires that dangled from the machine, then prepared for the final step. Down below, the crowd cackled like hens.</p><p>&#x201c;Quiet, everyone,&#x201d; someone said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see how crazy this boy really is.&#x201d;</p><p>Just then a strong gust of wind whistled through the rungs and pushed me into the tower. Reaching over, I unlocked the machine&#x2019;s spinning wheel and watched it begin to turn. Slowly at first, then faster and faster, until the whole tower rocked back and forth. My knees turned to jelly, but I held on.</p><p>I pleaded in silence:<i> Don&#x2019;t let me down.</i></p><p>Then I gripped the reed and wires and waited for the miracle of electricity. Finally, it came, a tiny flicker in my palm, and then a magnificent glow. The crowd gasped, and the children pushed for a better look.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s true!&#x201d; someone said.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said another. &#x201c;The boy has done it. He has made electric wind!&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>My name is William Kamkwamba, and to understand the story I&#x2019;m about to tell, you must first understand the country that raised me. Malawi is a tiny nation in southeastern Africa. On a map, it appears like a flatworm burrowing its way through Zambia, Mozambique, and Tanzania, looking for a little room. Malawi is often called &#x201c;The Warm Heart of Africa,&#x201d; which says nothing about its location, but everything about the people who call it home. The Kamkwambas hail from the center of the country, from a tiny village called Masitala, located on the outskirts of the town of Wimbe.</p><p>You might be wondering what an African village looks like. Well, ours consists of about ten houses, each one made of mud bricks and painted white. For most of my life, our roofs were made from long grasses that we picked near the swamps, or <i>dambos</i> in our Chichewa language. The grasses kept us cool in the hot months, but during the cold nights of winter, the frost crept into our bones and we slept under an extra pile of blankets.</p><p>Every house in Masitala belongs to my large extended family of aunts and uncles and cousins. In our house, there was me, my mother and father, and my six sisters, along with some goats and guinea fowl, and a few chickens.</p><p>When people hear I&#x2019;m the only boy among six girls, they often say, &#x201c;<i>Eh,</i> <i>bambo</i>&#x201d;&#x2014;which is like saying &#x201c;Hey, man&#x201d;&#x2014;&#x201c;so sorry for you!&#x201d; And it&#x2019;s true. The downside to having only sisters is that I often got bullied in school since I had no older brothers to protect me. And my sisters were always messing with my things&#x2014;especially my tools and inventions&#x2014;giving me no privacy.</p><p>Whenever I asked my parents, &#x201c;Why do we have so many girls in the first place?&#x201d; I always got the same answer: &#x201c;Because the baby store was all out of boys.&#x201d; But as you&#x2019;ll see in this story, my sisters are actually pretty great. And when you live on a farm, you need all of the help you can get.</p><p>My family grew maize, which is another word for white corn. In our language, we lovingly referred to it as <i>chimanga</i>. And growing <i>chimanga</i> required all hands. Every planting season, my sisters and I would wake up before dawn to hoe the weeds, dig our careful rows, then push the seeds gently into the soft soil. When it came time to harvest, we were busy again.</p><p>Most families in Malawi are farmers. We live our entire lives out in the countryside, far away from cities, where we can tend our fields and raise our animals. Where we live, there are no computers or video games, very few televisions, and for most of my life, we didn&#x2019;t have electricity&#x2014;just oil lamps that spewed smoke and coated our lungs with soot.</p><p>Farmers here have always been poor, and not many can afford an education. Seeing a doctor is also difficult, since most of us don&#x2019;t own cars. From the time we&#x2019;re born, we&#x2019;re given a life with very few options. Because of this poverty and lack of knowledge, Malawians found help wherever we could.</p><p>Many of us turned to magic&#x2014;which is how my story begins.</p><p>You see, before I discovered the miracles of science, I believed that magic ruled the world. Not magician magic, like pulling rabbits out of hats or sawing ladies in half, the sort of thing you see on television. It was an invisible kind of magic, one that surrounded us like the air we breathe.</p><p>In Malawi, magic came in many forms&#x2014;the most common being the witch doctor whom we called <i>sing&#x2019;anga</i>. The wizards were mysterious people. Some appeared in public, usually in the market on Sundays, sitting on blankets spread with bones, spices, and powders that claimed to cure everything from dandruff to cancer. Poor people walked many miles to visit these men, since they didn&#x2019;t have money for real doctors. This led to problems, especially if a person was truly sick.</p><p>Take diarrhea, for example. Diarrhea is a common ailment in the countryside that comes from drinking dirty water, and if left untreated, it can lead to dehydration. Every year, too many children die from something that&#x2019;s easily cured by a regimen of fluids and simple antibiotics. But without money or faith in modern medicine, the villager takes his chances with the <i>sing&#x2019;anga</i>&#x2019;s crude diagnosis:</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, I know what&#x2019;s wrong,&#x201d; the wizard says. &#x201c;You have a snail.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A snail?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m almost positive. We must remove it at once!&#x201d;</p><p>The wizard goes into his bag of roots, powders, and bones, and pulls out a lightbulb.</p><p>&#x201c;Lift up your shirt,&#x201d; he says.</p><p>Without plugging the bulb into anything, he moves it slowly across the person&#x2019;s stomach, as if to illuminate something only he can detect.</p><p>&#x201c;There it is! Can you see the snail moving?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh yes, I think I can see it. Yes, there it is!&#x201d;</p><p>The wizard returns to his bag for some magic potion, which he splashes across the belly.</p><p>&#x201c;All better?&#x201d; he asks.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, I think the snail is gone. I don&#x2019;t feel it moving.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good. That will be three thousand kwacha.&#x201d;</p><p>For a little extra money, the <i>sing&#x2019;anga</i> can cast curses on your enemies&#x2014;to deliver floods to their fields, hyenas to their chicken house, or terror and tragedy into their homes. This is what happened to me when I was six years old&#x2014;or at least I thought it did.</p><p>I was playing in front of my house when a group of boys walked past carrying a giant sack. They worked for a nearby farmer tending his cows. That morning, as they were moving the herd from one pasture to another, they discovered the sack lying on the road. Looking inside, they saw that it was filled with bubble gum. Can you imagine such a treasure? I can&#x2019;t begin to tell you how much I loved bubble gum!</p><p>Now, as they walked past, one of them spotted me playing in a puddle.</p><p>&#x201c;Should we give some to this boy?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t move or say a word. A bit of mud dripped from my hair.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Eh</i>, why not,&#x201d; his friend said. &#x201c;He looks kind of pathetic.&#x201d;</p><p>The boy reached into his bag and produced a rainbow of gumballs&#x2014;one of every color&#x2014;and dropped them into my hands. By the time the boys disappeared, I&#x2019;d shoved every one into my mouth. The sweet juices dribbled down my chin and stained my shirt.</p><p>Little did I know, but the bubble gum belonged to a local trader, who stopped by our house the next day. He told my father how the bag had dropped from his bicycle as he was leaving the market. By the time he circled back to look for it, the bag was gone. The people in the next village told him about the herd of boys. Now he wanted revenge.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve gone to see the <i>sing&#x2019;anga</i>,&#x201d; he told my father. &#x201c;And whoever ate that bubble gum will be sorry.&#x201d;</p><p>Suddenly I was terrified. I&#x2019;d heard what the <i>sing&#x2019;anga</i> could do to a person. In addition to delivering death and disease, the wizards controlled armies of witches who could kidnap me during the night and shrink me into a worm! I&#x2019;d even heard about them turning children into stones, leaving them to suffer an eternity in silence.</p><p>Already, I could feel the <i>sing&#x2019;anga</i> watching me, plotting his evil. With my heart racing, I ran into the forest behind my house to try to escape, but it was no use. I felt the strange warmth of his magic eye shining through the trees. He had me. At any moment, I would emerge from the forest as a beetle, or a trembling mouse to be eaten by the hawks. Knowing my time was short, I hurried home to where my father was plucking a pile of maize and tumbled into his lap.</p><p>&#x201c;It was me!&#x201d; I shouted, tears running down my cheeks. &#x201c;I ate the stolen gum. I don&#x2019;t want to die, Papa. Please don&#x2019;t let them take me.&#x201d;</p><p>My father looked at me for a second and shook his head. &#x201c;It was you, <i>eh</i>?&#x201d; he said, then kind of smiled.</p><p><i>Didn&#x2019;t he realize I was in trouble?</i></p><p>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; he said, and his knees popped as he rose from his chair. My father was a big man. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, William. I&#x2019;ll find the trader and explain. I&#x2019;m sure we can work something out.&#x201d;</p><p>That afternoon, my father walked five miles to the trader&#x2019;s house and told him what had happened. And even though I&#x2019;d only eaten a few of the gumballs, he paid the man for the entire bag, which was nearly all the money we possessed. That evening after supper, my life having been saved, I asked my father if he truly believed I was in trouble. He became very serious.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh yes, we were just in time,&#x201d; he said, then started laughing so hard his chair began to squeak. &#x201c;<i>William, who knows what was in store for you?</i>&#x201d;</p><p>My fear of wizards and magic only grew worse whenever Grandpa told stories. If you saw my grandpa, you might think he was a kind of wizard himself. He was so old that he couldn&#x2019;t remember the year he&#x2019;d been born. So cracked and wrinkled that his hands and feet looked as if they were chiseled from stone. And his clothes! Grandpa insisted on wearing the same tattered coat and trousers every day. Whenever he emerged from the forest, puffing on his hand-rolled cigar, you&#x2019;d think one of the trees had grown legs and started walking.</p><p>It was Grandpa who told me the greatest story about magic I&#x2019;d ever heard. Long ago, before the giant maize and tobacco farms came along and cleared away our great forests, when a person could lose track of the sun inside the trees, the land was rich with antelope, zebra, and wildebeest&#x2014;also lions, hippos, and leopards. Grandpa was a famous hunter, so good with his bow and arrow that it became his duty to protect his village and provide its meat.</p><p>One day while Grandpa was out hunting, he came across a man who&#x2019;d been killed by a poisonous pit viper. He alerted the nearest village, and soon after, they returned with their witch doctor.</p><p>The <i>sing&#x2019;anga</i> took one look at the dead man, then reached into his bag and tossed some medicines into the trees. Seconds later, the earth began to move as hundreds of vipers slithered out of the shadows and gathered around the corpse, hypnotized by the spell. The wizard then stood on the dead man&#x2019;s chest and drank a cup of potion, which seemed to flow through his feet and into the lifeless body. Then, to Grandpa&#x2019;s amazement, the dead man&#x2019;s fingers began to move and he sat up. Together, he and the wizard inspected the fangs of each snake, looking for the one that had bitten him.</p><p>&#x201c;Believe it,&#x201d; Grandpa told me. &#x201c;I saw this with my own eyes.&#x201d;</p><p>I certainly believed it, along with every other story about witches and things unexplained. Whenever I went down the dark trails alone, my imagination spun wild.</p><p>What scared me most were the <i>Gule Wamkulu,</i> the magical dancers that lived in the murky shadows of the forest. They sometimes appeared in the daylight, performing in tribal ceremonies when we Chewa boys became men. They were not real people, we were told, but spirits of our dead ancestors sent to roam the earth. Their appearance was ghastly: Each had the face and skin of animals and some walked on stilts to appear taller. Once, I saw one scurry backward up a pole like a spider. And when they danced, it was as if one thousand men were inside their bodies, each moving in the opposite direction.</p><p>When the <i>Gule Wamkulu</i> weren&#x2019;t performing, they traveled the forests and <i>dambos</i> looking for young boys to take back to the graveyards. What happened to you there, I never wanted to know. Whenever I saw one, even at a ceremony, I dropped everything and ran. Once, when I was very young, a magic dancer suddenly appeared in our courtyard. His head was wrapped in a flour sack, but underneath was the long nose of an elephant and a gaping hole for a mouth. My mother and father were in the fields, so my sisters and I ran for the bush, where we watched the dancer snatch our favorite chicken.</p><p>Unlike the <i>Gule Wamkulu</i> or <i>sing&#x2019;anga</i> in the market, most witches and wizards never revealed their identity. In the places where they practiced their magic, mystery abounded like strange weather. In the nearby town of Ntchisi, men with bald heads, standing as tall as trees, walked the roads at night. Ghost trucks traveled back and forth, approaching fast with their headlights flashing and engines revving loud. Yet when the lights finally passed, there was no truck attached. In one of the neighboring villages, I heard about a man who&#x2019;d been shrunk so small by a wizard that his wife kept him in a Coke bottle.</p><p>In addition to casting spells for curses, the <i>sing&#x2019;anga</i> often battled one another. At night, they piled aboard their planes and prowled the skies, looking for children to kidnap as soldiers. The witch planes could be anything: a wooden bowl, a broom, a simple hat. And each was capable of traveling great distances&#x2014;Malawi to New York, for example&#x2014;in a single minute. Children were used as guinea pigs and sent to test the powers of rival wizards. Other nights, they&#x2019;d visit camps of other witch children for games of mystical soccer, where the balls wer...</p></p><h2>Pink Floyd All the Songs: The Story Behind Every Track</h2><p><b>The newest addition to the best-selling <i>All the Songs</i> series details the unique recording history of Pink Floyd, one of the world's most commercially successful and influential rock bands.</b><br>Since 1965, Pink Floyd been recording sonically experimental and philosophical music, selling more than 250 million records worldwide, including two of the best-selling albums of all time <i>Dark Side of the Moon </i>and <i>The Wall</i>.

Francis Thurston goes through documents left behind by his grandfather&#x2019;s brother, recently deceased under mysterious circumstances. He soon discovers the existence of a cult that worships ancient and unspeakable horrors. Mysterious murders, blood rituals in the depths of the Louisiana swamps, artists who descend into insanity after nightmarish visions, and a Cyclopean city that rises from the sea. Step by step, Thurston realizes that his relative&#x2019;s research got too close to the truth. In the shadows, there are those who want to wake the sleeping god Cthulhu in order to spread madness and destruction over the entire world. The stars are right. Is the end near?<br><br>H.P. Lovecraft&#x2019;s The Call of Cthulhu, first published in 1928, is one of the greatest classics of American horror literature. Cthulhu himself, dreaming and waiting at the bottom of the sea, became a symbol for the entire mythology that Lovecraft created. Fran�ois Baranger, an illustrator who has previously worked in film and games, was fascinated early on by Lovecraft&#x2019;s creatures and visions which populated the darkest recesses of fantasy. In this book, he has taken on the work of illustrating Lovecraft&#x2019;s most iconic novel.</p><p>Fran�ois Baranger, born in 1970, is a multi-faceted artist and illustrator. He works primarily as a concept illustrator for films (Harry Potter, The Clash of the Titans, Beauty and the Beast) and computer games (Heavy Rain, Beyond: Two Souls). He has also illustrated a number of book covers. In 2013, he wrote his first science fiction novel, Dominium Mundi, and in 2017, he wrote the thriller The Domino Effect. It was during his early years that he discovered Lovecraft, mainly thanks to role-playing games. Ever since, he has had a passionate interest in fantasy worlds in general, and for those created by a certain writer from Providence in particular. After dreaming for years about seeing an illustrated version of Lovecraft&#39;s works, Baranger finally decided to create one himself, and chose the most classic short story of them all, The Call of Cthulhu.</p><h2>Mathematics for Machine Learning</h2><p>The fundamental mathematical tools needed to understand machine learning include linear algebra, analytic geometry, matrix decompositions, vector calculus, optimization, probability and statistics. These topics are traditionally taught in disparate courses, making it hard for data science or computer science students, or professionals, to efficiently learn the mathematics. This self-contained textbook bridges the gap between mathematical and machine learning texts, introducing the mathematical concepts with a minimum of prerequisites. It uses these concepts to derive four central machine learning methods: linear regression, principal component analysis, Gaussian mixture models and support vector machines. For students&nbsp;and others&nbsp;with a mathematical background, these derivations provide a starting point to machine learning texts. For&nbsp;those&nbsp;learning the mathematics for the first time, the methods help build intuition and practical experience with applying mathematical concepts. Every chapter includes worked examples and exercises to test understanding. Programming tutorials are offered on the book's web site.</p><p>This self-contained textbook introduces all the relevant mathematical concepts needed to understand and use machine learning methods, with a minimum of prerequisites.

Unlocking the simple secrets of this &#x201c;French paradox&#x201d;&#x2014;how they enjoy food while staying slim and healthy&#x2014;Mireille Guiliano gives us a charming, inspiring take on health and eating for our times. For anyone who has slipped out of her Zone, missed the flight to South Beach, or accidentally let a carb pass her lips, here is a positive way to stay trim, a culture&#x2019;s most precious secrets recast for the twenty-first century. A life of wine, bread&#x2014;even chocolate&#x2014;without girth or guilt?&nbsp;<i>Pourquoi pas?</i></p></p><p>The message of this book could be a blessing or a curse, depending on your perspective. There is no hard science, no clearly-defined plan, and no lists of food to have or have not; instead, you'll find simple tricks that boil down to eating carefully prepared seasonal food, exercising more and refusing to think of food as something that inspires guilt. It's both a practical message and far easier said than done in today's "no pain, no gain" culture. <p> Author Mireille Guiliano is CEO of Veuve Clicquot, and <i>French Women Don't Get Fat</i> offers a concept of sensible pleasures: If you have a chocolate croissant for breakfast, have a vegetable-based lunch--or take an extra walk and pass on the bread basket at dinner. Guiliano's insistence on simple measures slowly creating substantial improvements are reassuring, and her suggestion to ignore the scale and learn to live by the "zipper test" could work wonders for those who get wrapped up in tiny details of diet. She sympathizes that deprivation can lead straight to overindulgence when it comes to favorite foods, but then, in a most French manner, treats them as a pleasure that needs to be sated, rather than a battle to be fought. </p><p> A number of recipes are included, from a weight-loss enhancing leek soup to a lush chocolate mousse; they read more like what you'd find in a French cookbook rather than an American diet book. Most appealingly, these are guidelines and tricks that could be easily sustainable over a lifetime. If you agree that food is meant to be appreciated--but no more so than having a trim waist--these charmingly French recommendations could set you on the path to a future filled with both croissants and high fashion. <i>--Jill Lightner</i> </p><p> </p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <b>Amazon Exclusive Video</b> <br> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> Click here to watch Mireille Guiliano introduce <i>French Women Don&#x2019;t Get Fat</i> to Amazon customers. </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p> </p> </td> <td> <b>Gather Up Your Friends</b> <br> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> Click here to learn how to create your own reading group around <i>French Women Don&#x2019;t Get Fat</i>. </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p> </p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p></p> <br> <p> <b>Stuffed Cornish Hens</b> <br> <i>Serves 4</i><br> <br> When I grew up, the holidays always meant lots of visitors and a series of requisite celebratory meals, mostly at lunchtime. This easy dish was always on one of the menus. Mamie was usually busy (what else during late December?) and would make the stuffing in advance so lunch could be ready in less than an hour. The recipe serves a family of four for lunch in style, but double the ingredient portions and obviously you are ready for a full table with guests. <br> <br> <b>Ingredients</b>: <br> 2 Cornish hens (or poussins) <br> 2 tablespoons butter, melted<br> 3 tablespoons chicken stock<br> <b>Stuffing</b>: <br> 2 cups water <br> 2/3 cup brown rice <br> 1/2 cup mixed nuts (pine nuts, walnut pieces, whole hazelnuts) <br> 2 tablespoons golden raisins <br> 1/3 cup chicken stock <br> 1 tablespoon parsley, freshly minced <br>1 teaspoon dry herbs (chervil and savory or rosemary and thyme) <br> Salt and freshly ground pepper <br> <br> 1. For stuffing: Bring water to a boil. Add rice and cook for 15 minutes. Drain and mix well with remaining ingredients. Season to taste and refrigerate overnight.<br> 2. Preheat oven to 475 degrees. Rinse Cornish hens, dry the inside with paper towels, and season. Add stuffing loosely and truss hens. Reserve remaining stuffing in aluminum foil.<br> 3. Put hens in baking dish and brush them with melted butter and other seasonings. Put in oven and baste 10 minutes later with chicken stock. Continue basting every 10 minutes. After the hens have cooked for 20 minutes reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees and put the remaining stuffing in a small ovenproof dish. Roast the hens for another 20 minutes. Serve (half a hen per person) immediately with a tablespoon of stuffing on each side of the hen as garnish.<br> N.B. For a wonderful t�te-�-t�te romantic dinner, serve one hen each with a vegetable then dessert. I have prepared it successfully to my husband on Valentine&#x2019;s Day. While the hens are in the oven, you have time to concoct a little dessert, et voil�, you can pop a cork of bubbly, sit for candlelight dinner and have your husband serve dessert. </p> <p> <b>Hot Chocolate Souffl�</b> <br> <i>Serves 6</i> <br> <br> During the season of overindulgences&#x2014;Christmas, New Year and all the festivities in between&#x2014;there is in our home a succession of store-brought, traditional goodies: B�che de No�l (yule log), marrons glac�s (glazed chestnuts), the 13 desserts of Christmas in Provence. This is not to say that the holidays don&#x2019;t bring out the baker in all of us, but whether it is to give as gifts or to maintain tradition, people do load up with holiday sweets from pastry shops (as I can attest from seeing from the window of our Paris apartment the annual long lines of people outside the pastry shop across the street). When I grew up, however, come New Year&#x2019;s Day, and there was a home-cooked chocolate ritual. Our big festive meal was on New Year&#x2019;s Eve, which left New Year&#x2019;s Day as a quiet, family "recovery" day. (I appreciate some reverse the big meal day... or have one both days.) Anyway, for us, breakfast was well... late (especially for those of us who went partying after dinner), and limited to a piece of toast and a cup or two of coffee. Lunch was mid afternoon and usually made up of leftovers or an omelet, but the first dinner of the year was marked with a special dessert. The simple meal at the end of a week of overindulgences consisted of a light consomm�, some greens, cheese, and the chocolate treat. There were no guests, plenty of time, and Mamie was ready for the flourless souffl�. She is a chocoholic and it would be unthinkable to start the year off without chocolate. So, what better way to end the first day of the New Year than with one of her favorite chocolate desserts as both a reward and I&#x2019;m sure good-luck charm? <br> <br> <b>Ingredients</b>: <br> 1 cup milk <br> 1 cup unsweetened Dutch cocoa powder <br> 1/3 cup sugar <br> 4 eggs at room temperature <br> 2 tablespoons butter at room temperature <br> Pinch of salt <br> <br> 1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and prepare a 1-quart souffl� mold by lightly buttering it, dusting the insides with sugar and tapping out the excess. Place mold in refrigerator.<br> 2. Pour the milk, cocoa powder and sugar into a heavy saucepan and stir to combine. Bring to a boil over moderate heat while stirring constantly. Reduce the heat and cook while stirring until the mixture thickens (about 10 minutes). Transfer to a bowl and cool slightly. <br> 3. Separate the eggs and stir the egg yolks into the warm chocolate mixture. Stir in the butter. <br> 4. Beat the egg whites until they reach soft peaks. Add the salt and beat until stiff. Whisk half of the egg whites mixture into the chocolate mixture. Fold in the remaining whites gently with a spatula. Pour the mixture in the souffl� mold and smooth the top.<br> 5. Bake in the lower-middle shelf of the oven until puff and brown for about 18 minutes which will give you a soft center. Serve at once with softly whipped cream. <br> <br> <b>Red Mullet with Spinach en Papillote</b> <br> <i>Serves 4</i> <br> <br> <b>Ingredients</b>: <br> 2 teaspoons olive oil <br> 8 fillets of red mullet, about 2 ounces each <br> 1 lb. spinach, washed and dried in a salad spinner <br>4 teaspoons shallots, peeled and sliced <br> 8 slices of lime <br> 4 tablespoons of cr�me fra�che <br> Salt and freshly ground pepper <br> <br> 1. Cut 4 pieces of parchment paper (or aluminum foil) into squares large enough to cover each fillet and leave a 2-inch border all around. Lightly brush the squares with olive oil. Preheat oven to 300 degrees. <br> 2. Put the spinach in the center of each square and top it with a tablespoon of cr�me fra�che.

In her delightful tale, Mireille Guiliano unlocks the simple secrets of this "French paradox"-how to enjoy food and stay slim and healthy. Hers is a charming, sensible, and powerfully life-affirming view of health and eating for our times. <br>As a typically slender French girl, Mireille (Meer-"ray) went to America as an exchange student and came back fat. That shock sent her into an adolescent tailspin, until her kindly family physician, "Dr. Miracle," came to the rescue. Reintroducing her to classic principles of French gastronomy plus time-honored secrets of the local women, he helped her restore her shape and gave her a whole new understanding of food, drink, and life. The key? Not guilt or deprivation but learning to get the most from the things you most enjoy. Following her own version of this traditional wisdom, she has ever since relished a life of indulgence without bulge, satisfying yen without yo-yo on three meals a day. <br>Now in simple but potent strategies and dozens of recipes you'd swear were fattening, Mireille reveals the ingredients for a lifetime of weight control-from the emergency weekend remedy of Magical Leek Soup to everyday tricks like fooling yourself into contentment and painless new physical exertions to save you from the StairMaster. Emphasizing the virtues of freshness, variety, balance, and "always pleasure, Mireille shows how virtually anyone can learn to eat, drink, and move like a French woman. <br>Anatural raconteur, Mireille illustrates her philosophy through the experiences that have shaped her life-a six-year-old's first taste of Champagne, treks in search of tiny blueberries (called "myrtilles) in the woods near her grandmother's house, a near-spiritual rendezvous with oysters at a seaside restaurant in Brittany, to name but a few. She also shows us other women discovering the wonders of "French in action," drawing examples from dozens of friends and associates she has advised over the years to eat and drink smarter and more joyfully. <br>Here are a culture's most cherished and time-honored secrets recast for the twenty-first century. For anyone who has slipped out of her zone, missed the flight to South Beach, or accidentally let a carb pass her lips, here is a buoyant, positive way to stay trim. A life of wine, bread-even chocolate-without girth or guilt?

As our culture becomes more post-Christian with each passing day, we are all realizing that what has worked in the past is no longer working, that we are far less effective for the Kingdom than we were even 10 years ago. But we would suggest it isn't because we don't know what the Great Commission states or the imperatives of the Gospel, or that our church services just aren't getting it done.</p><p>Its because we are in the midst of a discipleship crisis in the Western church. The people sitting in our pews are rarely becoming like the people we read about in Scripture. They may come to a worship service, join a small group or even tithe, but their lives just don't seem to look like Jesus life.</p><p>The truth of the matter is that we don't have a missional problem or leadership problem in the Western church. We have a discipleship problem. If we make disciples like Jesus made them, well never have a problem finding leaders or seeing new people coming to faith.</p><p>The central issue is that we have no idea how to make disciples who can do the things that Jesus did for the reasons Jesus did them. Building a Discipling Culture is the product of more than 25 years of hands-on discipleship practice in a post-Christian context that has turned into a worldwide discipling movement, dealing specifically with how to make the types of missional disciples Jesus spoke of. We all want to make disciples. Most of us are unsure how to do it.</p><p>Dallas Willard put it this way: Every church needs to be able to answer two questions. One, do we have a plan for making disciples? Two, does our plan work?</p><p>For most of our church communities, we have a plan, but the plan isn't working.</p><p>If you find yourself in this situation, this book is for you.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Book of Strange but True Science</h2><p><b>Packed with hundreds of articles on the most interesting things that ever happened in science.

Happy reading.<br>&nbsp;<br>Interview with the Author&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Q - So, what makes HER special?&nbsp;</b><br>&nbsp;<br>A - It's a mixture of things, I think. When I set out to write this book, I wanted to create something that mirrored exactly the kind of books I like to read. My top picks are typically dark novels--psychological thrillers with heavy themes of suspense. While&nbsp;I read a wide range of books, my favorites tend to be domestically set psychological thrillers. I prefer high drama--edge&nbsp;of my seat tension--the kind that keeps me glued to the page. Basically, anything I can't look away from with a fast-paced style gets my vote.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>HER is a great mixture of these genres. Although, at its heart, it's a story about the choices we make. One that just so happens to keep you glued to the page. :)<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Q - Why should readers give this book a try?&nbsp;</b><br>&nbsp;<br>A - Well, if you're looking for a read that is full of mind games that'll keep you guessing, this novel might be for you.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Ultimately, I believe readers who enjoy lightning-fast pacing with a plot that twists and turns all the way to the end will get a kick out of this book.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Happy reading!&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>HER eBook Categories:&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>- Psychological Thrillers&nbsp;<br>- Mystery, Thriller &amp; Suspense&nbsp;<br>- Suspense&nbsp;<br>- Mystery &amp; Suspense&nbsp;<br>- Dark Romance&nbsp;<br>- Romantic Suspense&nbsp;<br>- Women's Fiction&nbsp;<br>- Contemporary Women&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- Psychological Thrillers 100 Must Reads&nbsp;<br>- Literary Fiction<br>- Literature &amp; Fiction&nbsp;<br>- Genre FictionBritney King writes psychological, domestic, and romantic thrillers set in suburbia.

The test is a requirement for candidates seeking a Core Subjects EC-6 certificate. Because it&#x2019;s a computer- administered test, the Core Subjects EC-6 exam is available throughout the year at numerous locations across the state and at select locations nationally. To find the test center near you, visit <i>www.texes.ets.org</i>.</p><p>Candidates are limited to five attempts to take any of Texas&#x2019;s teacher certification tests, but in the event you don&#x2019;t pass the Core Subjects EC-6 test, you need to retake only the individual subtest(s) where your score falls short.</p><b></b><p><b>What is the format of the TExES Core Subjects EC-6 test?<br></b>The test includes a total of 267 items, with 230 scorable multiple-choice items, and 37 nonscorable items used for field testing. You won&#x2019;t know which is which, so they surely aren&#x2019;t worth worrying about. Your final scaled score will be based only on the scorable items. The test is organized into five subject tests.</p><b></b><p><b>Multiple-Choice Questions<br></b>Though all the questions on the test are multiple-choice, they may not all be the type of multiple-choice question with which you&#x2019;re familiar. The majority of questions on the Core Subjects test are standard multiple-choice items. The questions are not intended merely to test your command of facts but also your critical-thinking skills. For example, you may be asked to analyze information and compare it with knowledge you have, or make a judgment about it. To acquaint yourself with all the standards and competencies covered on the test, be sure to download Educational Testing Service&#x2019;s test framework at <i>www.texes.ets.org</i>.</p><p>Some multiple-choice questions are self-contained while others are clustered, branching off a common stimulus. Each question will generally have four choices: A, B, C, and D. (Some questions may have five options.) In most cases, the correct answer will require you to identify the single best response. Some questions, however, will require you to select <i>all </i>the responses that answer the question correctly. In such instances, you will click check boxes instead of ovals. Also be aware that this test occasionally presents non-traditional formats for multiple-choice items, both to present the information and to allow you to select the best answer. </p><b></b><p><b>When should the test be taken?<br></b>Traditionally, teacher preparation programs determine when their candidates take the required tests for teacher certification. These programs will also clear you to take the examinations and make final recommendations for certification to the Texas State Board for Educator Certification (SBEC).</p><p>A candidate seeking EC-6 certification may take the appropriate Core Subjects test at such time as his or her Educator Preparation Program (EPP) determines the candidate&#x2019;s readiness to take the test, or upon successful completion of the EPP, whichever comes first. The EPP will determine readiness through benchmarks and structured assessments of the candidates&#x2019; progress throughout the preparation program.</p><p>For those seeking certification right out of college, the TExES 291 Core Subjects EC&#x2013;6 is generally taken just before graduation. Taking all TExES examinations is a requirement to teach in Texas, so if you are planning on being an educator, you must take and pass these tests.</p><b></b><p><b>How do I register for the test?<br></b>To register for the TExES 291 test, you must create an account in the ETS online registration system. Registration will then be available to you online, 24/7, during the regular, late, and emergency registration periods. Visit ETS&#x2019;s TExES website at <i>www.texes.ets.org </i>and follow the instructions.</p><p>The TExES Registration Bulletin provides information about test dates and locations, as well as information on registration and testing accommodations for those with special needs. The registration bulletin is available at <i>http://cms.texes-ets.org/registrationbulletin/.</i></p><p>Registration bulletins are also available at the education departments of Texas colleges and universities. To address issues that cannot be solved at the teacher preparation program level, you can contact the offices of SBEC at (888) 863-5880 or (512) 469-8400. You can also find information about the test and registration on the ETS website at <i>http://cms.texes-ets.org/.</i></p><p>You must pay a registration fee to take the TExES tests, and you will also incur additional late fees if registering after the scheduled date.</p><b></b><p><b>What&#x2019;s the passing score?<br></b>There are 267 multiple-choice questions on the TExES 291 test. Your score on each of the TExES 291&#x2019;s subtests (test codes 801 to 805) will be reported on a 100-300 scale. A scaled score of 240 is set as the minimum passing score. To put this in context, you want to be confident you can answer between 70% and 80% of the questions correctly. To achieve the 70% level, you must get 190 questions correct; to reach the 80% level, you need to get 214 questions correct. As you work your way through our practice tests, scores in this range will suggest that you are sufficiently absorbing the test content. On the actual test, 32 of the 267 questions are being field-tested and thus will not be scored. There is no holistic score for the full Core Subjects EC-6 battery; overall results are reported as &#x201c;pass&#x201d; or &#x201c;not pass&#x201d; because, as ETS puts it, &#x201c;there is no total scaled score for the overall exam.&#x201d;</p><p>If you do not get a passing score on our online diagnostic test or the practice tests, review your online score report and study the detailed explanations for the questions you answered incorrectly. Note which types of questions you answered wrong, and re-examine the corresponding review content. After further review, you may want to retake the practice tests online.</p><b></b><p><b>When will I receive my score report?<br></b>As part of the registration process to take TExES examinations, test candidates set up an account with ETS in which they are assigned a username and password. Use this account to access your score report information on ETS&#x2019;s TExES website. Score reports will be posted by 5 p.m. CT on the score reporting date and will be available for 90 days.</p><b></b><p><b>What if I don&#x2019;t pass each subject area subtest?<br></b>You must pass all parts of the Core Subjects EC-6 test in order to meet the examination requirement for Texas&#x2019;s Core Subjects EC-6 certificate. If you don&#x2019;t do well on every part of the Core Subjects test, don&#x2019;t panic. You can retake the entire test or any individual subject area subtests up to four times. Both options require a 45-day waiting period after the first and subsequent attempts.</p><p>You are given four attempts to retake all portions of the Core Subjects exams. On your first retake, the Texas Education Agency requires that you attempt the entire Core Subjects exam. After the first attempt, each testing session counts as another try, regardless of whether the session includes the entire exam or one of the subject area subtests. Candidates retaking the entire Core Subjects battery must literally view (but not answer) all of the test questions in each subtest.</p></p><h2>Freedom Walkers: The Story of the Montgomery Bus Boycott Grades 6-8</h2><p><b>A riveting account of the civil rights boycott that changed history by the foremost author of history for young people.</b> <br><br>Now a classic, Freedman&#x2019;s book tells the dramatic stories of the heroes who stood up against segregation and Jim Crow laws in 1950s Alabama. &nbsp;A master of succinct historical narratives, Freeman explains the contributions of and sacrifices made by Rosa Parks and Claudette Colvin, who refused give up their seats, to Jo Ann Robinson, who began the boycott, to Martin Luther King, Jr., whose leadership was instrumental is carrying it through, and others. <br><br>Full of eye-witness reports, iconic photographs from the era, and crucial primary sources, this work brings the narratives alive for contemporary readers. A map, source notes, a bibliography, and other backmatter make is a valuable classroom resource. <br><br>Recipient of an Orbis Pictus Honor, the Flora Stieglitz Straus Award, and the Jane Addams Peace Association Honor Book Award, <i>Freedom Walkers </i>received five starred reviews.</p><p>Russell Freedman (1929-2018) transformed non-fiction for children through his insightful narrative, comprehensive research, careful selection of photographs, and deep understanding of his subject matter. He was&nbsp;well known for his riveting biographies and masterful accounts of the history of the United States. One of the most honored writers for children, his many awards include the Newbery Medal, three Newbery Honor Medals, the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award, the May Hill Arbuthnot Honor Lecture Award and a National Humanities Medal. Major works include&nbsp;<i>Freedom Walkers, Lincoln: A Photobiography, Because They Marched, The Wright Brothers: How They Invented The Airplane.&nbsp;</i><i>Starred Review.</i> Grade 4-6&#x2013;Freedman begins this outstanding history by reminding his audience that the injustices of racial segregation did not happen that long ago in the United States. Throughout the book, he gives accounts of how much coordination and sacrifice went into conducting the Montgomery Bus Boycott&#x2013;far more than students are likely to imagine from the usual popular and oversimplified versions offered in textbooks and on television. There is a refreshing emphasis on depictions of regular people and forgotten local crusaders working together to make the boycott possible and triumphant, from inspiring descriptions of drivers getting up at dawn to take others to work to accounts of well-known civil-rights lawyers working to find the right plaintiff to challenge unjust laws. Freedman's prose style pulls readers into the narrative, integrating the actual recorded words and deeds of the people to tell the story. The high-quality, black-and-white photographs range from everyday scenes of African-American boycotters meeting, waiting for carpools, and protesting to representations of more famous figures, such as Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King, Jr., etc. Extensive chapter notes, an annotated selected bibliography, and a thorough index round out the exemplary presentation. Pair this volume with Ann Bausum's <i>Freedom Riders</i> (National Geographic) and Nikki Giovanni's <i>Rosa</i> (Holt, both 2005) for a powerful introduction to the Civil Rights Movement.<i>&#x2013;Michael Santangelo, Brooklyn Public Library, NY</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Wyatt, his best friend, Matt, and a few kids from Culver Middle School find themselves in a heap of trouble-not just with their teachers, who have long lost patience with them-but from several mysterious men they first meet on their flight to the nation's capital. In a fast-paced adventure with the monuments as a backdrop, the kids try to stay out of danger and out of the doghouse while trying to save the president from attack-or maybe not.<br></p><p>Dave Barry is a Pulitzer Prize-winning author of more than two dozen books including the just-released <i>You Can Date When You're 40</i>. Along with Ridley Pearson, he is the co-author of the Peter and the Starcatchers series and <i>Science Fair</i><i>. </i>Dave, his wife Michelle and their family live in Miami, Florida<i>.</i>A Miami eighth-grader's class trip to the nation's capital quickly escalates into an international incident.Wyatt Palmer wants nothing more than a nice, peaceful, informative class trip to Washington, D.C. But when his best friend, Matt, spots some suspicious activity on their plane, his dream vanishes-in a big way. Soon Matt is kidnapped, possibly by international terrorists, and it's up to Wyatt and the girl of his dreams to find him and exchange a deadly device for their lost friend. That all sounds heavy, but humor columnist Barry sprinkles enough laughs throughout to keep things moving smoothly. The novel's ludicrous scenario is met with an equally comic tone, making for a fast-paced, easy read. The author sup! plies these kids with enough smarts to get out of jams but enough vulnerabilities to keep readers engaged. At no point will readers be worried about the fate of the world, but whether or not Wyatt and his pals make it out in one piece is another matter. The book's shortcomings are few: the adult characters are as flat as the children are round, some of the slapstick goes a bit too far, and the final pages are overstuffed with expository "this is how everybody ended up" chunks of text. A light, comic tone and more-or-less believable stakes make for a winning combination.&#x2015;<b><i>Kirkus</i></b><br><br>Check your disbelief at the TSA line for this hilarious jaunt from Miami to Washington, D.C., with the civics students of Culver Middle School. Trouble starts on the airplane, where Wyatt Palmer and friend Matt Diaz notice that some nearby passengers have aerial photos of the White House and a backpack they are reluctant to stow under the seat in front of them. When an electronic device falls out of the bag, Matt pockets it, setting off a chain of events that leads to two kidnappings and an international incident in the Rose Garden involving the President, a foreign dignitary, a dragon kite, an angry cab driver, and more. (Suggested alternate title: The Worst School Chaperones Ever.) The boys are aided by the apple of Wyatt's eye, Suzana Delgado, who they are surprised to learn is not only an excellent soccer player but "basically a Navy SEAL disguised as a hot eighth-grade girl." Pulitzer-winner Barry has the comic sensibility of a middle-school class clown. Expect to have lots of trouble keeping this one on the shelf.&#x2015;<b><i>Publisher's Weekly</i></b><br><br>On a class trip to Washington, DC, eighth grader Wyatt Palmer and his best friend Matt believe that they have uncovered a terrorist plot. The men seated behind them in the airplane are oddly protective of their luggage and spend their time during the flight studying aerial photos of the White House. During a scuffle with these passengers, Matt removes an odd device from one man's backpack. This event gets Matt and Wyatt into trouble with their teacher, not to mention a stern lecture from the Federal Air Marshal, but they figure it will be worth it if they have foiled a terrorist plot. Unfortunately, Wyatt and Matt have not seen the last of those two men. For the rest of their trip, Wyatt, Matt, and a few more of their classmates (including Wyatt's crush Suzana) avoid bad guys, sneak away from the rest of their class, and conceal the whole situation from their chaperones. If everything goes well, Wyatt can save the country and get the girl-but when has anything on this trip gone well for Wyatt? Barry's trademark humor shines in this tale of a field trip gone hilariously wrong. While Wyatt's adventures occasionally push the boundaries of credulity, his escapades are so funny that readers are likely to be forgiving. VERDICT With its wacky humor and mildly suspenseful scenarios, this appealing book will be a good fit for most libraries.&#x2015;<b><i>School Library Journal</i></b></p><h2>Buckets, Dippers, and Lids: Secrets to Your Happiness</h2><p><i>"Buckets, Dippers, and Lids is <b>a well-constructed, inspirational self-help book for young readers</b>.

Drawing on his own struggles with the illness and interviews with fellow sufferers, doctors and scientists, policy makers and politicians, drug designers, and philosophers, Andrew Solomon reveals the subtle complexities and sheer agony of the disease as well as the reasons for hope. He confronts the challenge of defining the illness and describes the vast range of available medications and treatments, and the impact the malady has on various demographic populations&#x2014;around the world and throughout history. He also explores the thorny patch of moral and ethical questions posed by biological explanations for mental illness. With uncommon humanity, candor, wit and erudition, award-winning author Solomon takes readers on a journey of incomparable range and resonance into the most pervasive of family secrets. His contribution to our understanding not only of mental illness but also of the human condition is truly stunning.</p><p>Sometimes, the legacy of depression includes a wisdom beyond one's years, a depth of passion unexperienced by those who haven't traveled to hell and back. Off the charts in its enlightening, comprehensive analysis of this pervasive yet misunderstood condition, <i>The Noonday Demon</i> forges a long, brambly path through the subject of depression--exposing all the discordant views and "answers" offered by science, philosophy, law, psychology, literature, art, and history. The result is a sprawling and thoroughly engrossing study, brilliantly synthesized by author Andrew Solomon. <p> Deceptively simple chapter titles (including "Breakdowns," "Treatments," "Addiction," "Suicide") each sit modestly atop a virtual avalanche of Solomon's intellect. This is not a book to be skimmed. But Solomon commands the language--and his topic--with such grace and empathy that the constant flow of references, poems, and quotations in his paragraphs arrive like welcome dinner guests. A longtime sufferer of severe depression himself, Solomon willingly shares his life story with readers. He discusses updated information on various drugs and treatment approaches while detailing his own trials with them. He describes a pharmaceutical company's surreal stage production (involving Pink Floyd, kick dancers, and an opener � la <i>Cats</i>) promoting a new antidepressant to their sales team. He chronicles his research visits to assorted mental institutions, which left him feeling he would "<i>much</i> rather engage with every manner of private despair than spend a protracted time" there. Under Solomon's care, however, such tales offer much more than shock value. They show that depression knows no social boundaries, manifests itself quite differently in each person, and has become political. And, while it may worsen or improve, depression will never be eradicated. Hope lies in finding ways--as Solomon clearly has--to harness its powerful lessons. <i>--Liane Thomas</i></p>The 2001 National Book Award Winner for Nonfiction.</p><h2>Stock Investing For Beginners: How To Buy Your First Stock And Grow Your Money</h2><p>A former janitor and gas station attendant in Vermont, who died a few years ago, surprised everyone by leaving an $8 million fortune to his local library and hospital.<br> What was his secret, everyone wondered?

The story is riveting, the participants breathe and feel and are alive, and throughout this elegantly-told novel, music pours forth so splendidly that the reader hears it and is overwhelmed by its beauty.&#x201d; &#x2014;Lloyd Moss, WXQR</p><p>&#x201c;Glorious.&#x201d; &#x2014;<em>The New Yorker</em></p><p>Ann Patchett&#x2019;s award winning, <em>New York Times </em>bestselling <em>Bel Canto </em>balances themes of love and crisis as disparate characters learn that music is their only common language. As in Patchett&#x2019;s other novels, including <em>Truth &amp; Beauty&nbsp;</em>and <em>The Magician&#x2019;s Assistant</em>, the author&#x2019;s lyrical prose and lucid imagination make <em>Bel Canto </em>a captivating story of strength and frailty, love and imprisonment, and an inspiring tale of transcendent romance.</p></p><p>In an unnamed South American country, a world-renowned soprano sings at a birthday party in honor of a visiting Japanese industrial titan. His hosts hope that Mr. Hosokawa can be persuaded to build a factory in their Third World backwater. Alas, in the opening sequence, just as the accompanist kisses the soprano, a ragtag band of 18 terrorists enters the vice-presidential mansion through the air conditioning ducts. Their quarry is the president, who has unfortunately stayed home to watch a favorite soap opera. And thus, from the beginning, things go awry.<p> Among the hostages are not only Hosokawa and Roxane Coss, the American soprano, but an assortment of Russian, Italian, and French diplomatic types. Reuben Iglesias, the diminutive and gracious vice president, quickly gets sideways of the kidnappers, who have no interest in him whatsoever. Meanwhile, a Swiss Red Cross negotiator named Joachim Messner is roped into service while vacationing. He comes and goes, wrangling over terms and demands, and the days stretch into weeks, the weeks into months.</p><p> With the omniscience of magic realism, Ann Patchett flits in and out of the hearts and psyches of hostage and terrorist alike, and in doing so reveals a profound, shared humanity. Her voice is suitably lyrical, melodic, full of warmth and compassion. Hearing opera sung live for the first time, a young priest reflects: </p><blockquote> Never had he thought, never once, that such a woman existed, one who stood so close to God that God's own voice poured from her. How far she must have gone inside herself to call up that voice. It was as if the voice came from the center part of the earth and by the sheer effort and diligence of her will she had pulled it up through the dirt and rock and through the floorboards of the house, up into her feet, where it pulled through her, reaching, lifting, warmed by her, and then out of the white lily of her throat and straight to God in heaven. </blockquote> Joined by no common language except music, the 58 international hostages and their captors forge unexpected bonds. Time stands still, priorities rearrange themselves. Ultimately, of course, something has to give, even in a novel so imbued with the rich imaginative potential of magic realism. But in a fractious world, <i>Bel Canto</i> remains a gentle reminder of the transcendence of beauty and love. <i>--Victoria Jenkins</i><p>Somewhere in South America, at the home of the country's vice president, a lavish birthday party is being held in honor of the powerful businessman Mr. Hosokawa. Roxane Coss, opera's most revered soprano, has mesmerized the international guests with her singing. It is a perfect evening&#x2014;until a band of gun-wielding terrorists takes the entire party hostage. But what begins as a panicked, life-threatening scenario slowly evolves into something quite different, a moment of great beauty, as terrorists and hostages forge unexpected bonds, and people from different continents become compatriots. Friendship, compassion, and the chance for great love lead the characters to forget the real danger that has been set in motion . . . and cannot be stopped. </p></p><h2>Windows Internals, Part 2 (Developer Reference)</h2><p>Drill down into Windows architecture and internals, discover how core Windows components work behind the scenes, and master information you can continually apply to improve architecture, development, system administration, and support. <br> Led by three renowned Windows internals experts, this classic guide is now fully updated for Windows 10 and 8.x.

Listening, I heard no other sound. My imagination was creating foes where none existed.<br> &nbsp;<br> Only hours ago death had visited this place. This heap of charred ruins had been my home, and a night ago I had lain staring into the darkness of the ceiling, dreaming as always of lands beyond the sea.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now my mother lay in a shallow grave, dug by my own hands, and my home was a ruin where rainwater gathered in the hollows of the ancient stone floor, a floor put down by my ancestors before memory began.<br> &nbsp;<br> Already dawn was suggesting itself to the sky. Waiting an instant longer, my knife held low in my fist, I told myself, &#x201c;I will have that gold or kill any who comes between it and me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Fire no longer smoldered among the fallen roof beams, for rain had damped it out, leaving the smell of charred wood when it has become wet, and the smell of death.<br> &nbsp;<br> Darting from the shadows to the well coping, I ran my hand down inside the mouth of the well, counting down the cold stones.<br> &nbsp;<br> Two...three...four...five!<br> &nbsp;<br> With the point of my fine Damascus dagger, I worked at the mortar. Despite the damp chill, perspiration beaded my brow. At any time the men of Tournemine might return.<br> &nbsp;<br> The stone loosened. Working it free with my fingers, I lifted it to the well coping. Sheathing my knife, I ran my fingers into the hole, feeling for the box my father had hidden there. They touched wood. Gently, carefully, I drew it from the hole, a small box of strange-smelling wood. Then from behind me, a soft footfall!<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Turning, I saw that a dark figure loomed before me. So large a man could only be Taillefeur, lieutenant to the Baron de Tournemine, a veteran of mercenary wars.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;So!&#x201d; Taillefeur was pleased. &#x201c;I was right! The old wolf hid treasure, and the cub has returned for it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It is nothing,&#x201d; I lied, &#x201c;some trifles my father left me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Let me have those trifles&#x201d;&#x2014;Taillefeur extended his hand&#x2014;&#x201c;and you can be on your way. Let Tournemine hunt his own children.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The night was cold. The wind chilled my body beneath the rain-soaked clothing. Nearby a large drop fell into a puddle with a faint plop.<br> &nbsp;<br> Among those who stopped at the house of my father over the years had been a lean and savage man with a knife-scarred, pockmarked skin. Grasping my arm with fingers that bit into my flesh like claws, he grinned a lopsided grin and advised, &#x201c;Trust to your wits, boy, and to your good right hand.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He had emptied his glass, leering. &#x201c;And if you&#x2019;ve a good left and some gold, that helps, too!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> My left&#x2014;my left hand rested upon the stone I had removed from the well coping.<br> &nbsp;<br> Boy I might be, but I was tall and strong as a man, dark as an Arab from the sun, for I was not long from the fishing banks beyond Iceland where I had gone with men from the isle of Brehat.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;If I give you the box,&#x201d; I said as I gripped the stone tighter, &#x201c;you will let me go?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You are nothing to me. Give me the box.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He reached a hand to receive it, and I swung the stone.<br> &nbsp;<br> Too late, Taillefeur threw up his arm to ward off the blow. He saved himself a crushed skull, but the blow felled him in his tracks.<br> &nbsp;<br> Leaping over his body, I fled to the moors, and for the second time in a few hours the moors were my saving.<br> &nbsp;<br> What boy does not know the land of his boyhood? Every cave, every dolmen, every dip in the land and hole in the hedges, and all that lonely, rockbound coast for miles.<br> &nbsp;<br> There I had played and imagined myself in wars, and there I could run, dodge, and elude. As I had run that afternoon to evade the men of Tournemine, so I ran now.<br> &nbsp;<br> Behind me Taillefeur staggered to his feet. He got up and, groggy from my blow, staggered into the wall. I heard him curse. He must have glimpsed me running, because he gave a great shout and started after me.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Dodging into a hollow choked with brush, I scrambled through a tunnellike passage known to wolves and boys, and as the storm clouds were scattering like sheep to feed on the meadow of the sky, I came again to the cove.<br> &nbsp;<br> The ship was there. The crew was ashore filling casks with water, and when they saw me coming, two of them drew swords and a third nocked an arrow to his bowstring, looking beyond to see if I was accompanied.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was a squat, ill-painted vessel with a slanting mast and a single bank of oars, nothing like the sleek black ships of my father, who was a corsair.<br> &nbsp;<br> The two who held swords advanced, looking fiercer when they realized I was but a boy, and alone.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I would speak with your captain,&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;<br> They indicated a squat man, running somewhat to fat, in a dirty red cloak. His skin was swarthy, his eyes deep-sunk and furtive. I liked not the look of him and would have withdrawn had not the men of Tournemine been behind me, and searching.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A boy!&#x201d; He spoke impatiently.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But a tall boy,&#x201d; one of them assured him, &#x201c;and a strong lad, too!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Where do you sail?&#x201d; I asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Where the wind takes us.&#x201d; He eyed me with no favor, yet with a measuring quality in his glance.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;To Cyprus, perhaps? Or Sicily?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He gave me quick attention, for such places were known to few but wandering merchants or Crusaders. But we upon this coast of Brittany were born to the sea. We were descendants of the Veneti, those Celtic seafaring men who, with their Druid priests, refused tribute to Rome and defied the legions of Julius Caesar.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What do you know of Cyprus?&#x201d; he sneered.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;My father may be there. I seek him.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It is a far place. What would a father of yours be doing there?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;My father,&#x201d; I said proudly, &#x201c;is Kerbouchard!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> They were astonished, as I expected, for the ships of Kerbouchard harried the coasts; attacking the ships of many nations, trading beyond the farthest seas. My father&#x2019;s name was legend.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Your voyage would be useless. By the time you came to Cyprus, he would have sailed.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There were lessons I had yet to learn, and one was not to talk too much. &#x201c;His ship has been sunk, and my father has been killed or sold into slavery. I must find him.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The captain seemed relieved, for no man wishes to incur the displeasure of Kerbouchard, and he knew what he planned to do. Tall I was, and broader of shoulder than all but two of his crew.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ah? If you sail, will you work or pay?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;If the price be not too great, I will pay.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The men of the crew edged nearer, and I wished for a sword. Yet what choice remained? I must escape with them or face the dogs of Tournemine.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I could offer a piece of gold,&#x201d; I suggested.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You would eat that much!&#x201d; he said contemptuously, but his hard little eyes sharpened.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Two pieces?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Where would a boy lay his hands upon gold?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> His sudden gesture took me by surprise, and before I could move to resist, I had been seized and thrown to the ground. Despite my struggles, the box was torn from my shirt and broken open. Bright gold spilled upon the sand, and some of the coins rolled, setting off a greedy scramble.<br> &nbsp;<br> The captain took the gold from their reluctant fingers to be divided among the crew. &#x201c;Take him aboard,&#x201d; he commanded. &#x201c;He has paid his way, but he shall work also or taste the whip.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;My knife was jerked from its sheath by a moonfaced man with unkempt hair, who belted it. Him I would not forget. Damascus blades were hard to come by, and this was a gift from my father.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve learned something,&#x201d; the captain said, maliciously. &#x201c;Never show your money before strangers. But do your work, and you shall live to see Sicily. I know a Turk there who will pay a pretty price for such a handsome lad.&#x201d; He grinned at me. &#x201c;Although you may not long be a lad after he lays hands upon you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Bruised and battered I was, but when my foot touched the deck a thrill went along my spine. Yet when taken to my place at the slaves&#x2019; bench, and seeing the filth in which I must work, I tried to fight. That men could exist in such evil conditions seemed impossible, although there was little cleanliness in the houses along our coast, other than in my father&#x2019;s house.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He had traveled in Moslem lands in Africa and Spain, and brought to our house not only their rich fabrics but their way of living and their love of hot baths.<br> &nbsp;<br> Shackled to my oar, I looked about me with distaste. How long I could endure this I had no idea, yet a time would come when I would learn how much a man can endure and yet survive. The condition of these galley slaves was abject, and I pitied them, and myself as well. Their backs bore evidence of what happened when their overseer walked along the benches with his whip.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>TouchThinkLearn: Vehicles: (Board Books for Baby Learners, Touch Feel Books for Children)</h2><p>Featuring spreads each with raised shaped objects that fit into scooped cutouts on their opposite page, these two new TouchThinkLearn books offer the youngest learners an irresistible opportunity to explore their universe in a hands-on, multisensory way.

I was able to make that into a reality, well for the most part, other than the personal recognition part.</p><p>&nbsp;Thought the process was extremely tedious and difficult especially since I didn&#x2019;t know much about starting a business. &nbsp;Only passion I ever had was to make beautiful soaps and boy! I made some great ones. But soon after starting to build my business I realized, making soap is totally different than making the soap making into a full blow business.</p><p>The learning curve was steep, and I was determined to make a go of it even if that meant I would have to sacrifice whatever I had. I took me two long years to finally be able to break through all the walls and see success. I build my business from zero to a 6 figure business in 26 months which is little over two years&#x2019; time.</p><p>By then I figured out the Ins and Outs of this business and had a great distribution channel set up who were helping to market my soap all over the country. My soaps were mostly selling in boutique shops, some TJ Maxx, Marshalls, and Home Goods and even in few Whole Foods market.</p><p>One day I got a call from an agent who was representing a name brand soap company and they expressed interest in buying my business. After three months of hard negotiation and planning, I was able to sell them my company for a good price. Due to the NDA agreement, I cannot disclose their name or how much I sold my company for, but let&#x2019;s just say I am happy and content. Now I can pursue other dreams I have. But I can&#x2019;t start another soap manufacturing company in next seven years as that is the Non-Compete Agreement I had to sign with them.</p><p>Since I can&#x2019;t make soap anymore, I have decided to share my &#x201c;know how&#x201d; so you don&#x2019;t have to go through what I have gone through and waste two years trying to make a go of it.</p><p><br></p></p><h2>Hot Sauce Cookbook: The Book of Fiery Salsa and Hot Sauce Recipes</h2><p>Make Your Favorite Hot Sauces with The Hot Sauce Cookbook The recipes in The Hot Sauce Cookbook will have you wiping your brow, chugging water, and helping yourself to seconds.

The Suzuki Method(R) of Talent Education is based on Shinichi Suzuki's view that every child is born with ability, and that people are the product of their environment. According to Shinichi Suzuki, a world-renowned violinist and teacher, the greatest joy an adult can know comes from developing a child's potential so he/she can express all that is harmonious and best in human beings. Students are taught using the "mother-tongue" approach. Each series of books for a particular instrument in the Suzuki Method is considered a Suzuki music school, such as the Suzuki Cello School. Suzuki lessons are generally given in a private studio setting with additional group lessons. The student listens to the recordings and works with their Suzuki cello teacher to develop their potential as a musician and as a person. This Suzuki book for Volume 4 is integral for Suzuki cello lessons. <br><br>Titles: Sonata in E Minor, Op. 14, No. 5 (Largo, Allegro, Largo, Allegro) (Vivaldi) * Danse Rustique, Op. 20, No. 5 (Squire) * Arioso from Cantata 156 (Bach) * Rondo from Concerto No. 4, Op. 65 (Goltermann). <br><br>For a complete list of the most recent printings by AMPV number, go to alfred.com/suzuki.

Your body is built to move.<br><br>Lizzy Rockwell explains how your bones and muscles, heart and lungs, nerves and brain all work together to keep you on the go. Kids walk and skate and tumble through these pages with such exuberance that even sprouting couch potatoes will want to get up and bounce around&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s the ultimate goal. Studies show that American kids are becoming more sedentary and more overweight and that they carry these tendencies with them into adolescence and adulthood. Experts agree that we need to help kids make physical activity a life-long habit. Through education, information, and encouragement, this book aims to inspire a new generation of busy bodies!</p><p>Lizzy Rockwell stays fit through yoga, walking the dog, and keeping up with her two boys.Dear Parents and Teachers,<br><br>It's easy to see that children love to move. How many times have you had to ask a child to sit still&#x2014;in the car, at school, or at the dining table? Being physically active makes kids feel good. They breathe deeply, filling their lungs with energizing oxygen. They use their muscles, releasing mood-improving endorphins. Regular physical activity helps children eat well, sleep well, perform well in school, resist illness, and grow strong, cheerful, and confident.<br><br>The good news is that being physically active is natural for children. The bad news is that today many children are not active enough to stay healthy. The number of seriously overweight children in the United States has tripled in the past twenty years. Obesity is linked to other serious health risks such as diabetes, heart disease, osteoporosis, and depression. While diet plays a major role in our children's health, physical activity is an equally important factor. Surveys show that as many as half of our children do not get even a moderate (30 minutes a day, five days a week) amount of exercise. Yet they now spend an average of four hours a day in front of the TV or computer. Even children who do not gain weight easily are often not active enough to keep their heart, lungs, bones, and muscles in good condition. By giving our children education and positive guidance, we take the first steps in breaking this pattern.<br><br>When children know about the remarkable potential of their bodies, they want to test it out. When they see others engaged in activities that look fun and stimulating, they want to join in. As parents and educators, we can set examples of healthy living by making changes in our own habits. Small lifestyle adjustments can communicate that fitness is a priority. We can walk to school or the store, set limits on sedentary activities, take the stairs instead of the elevator. In <i>The Busy Body Book</i>, I have chosen friendly, encouraging words and images that I hope will inspire children to make their own good choices. This book is for the competitive athlete as well as the contemplative artist. I hope that all children will find themselves in its pages, feel proud of their bodies, and be inspired to move. Physical activity is natural for all of us. So let's get busy and have some fun!<br><br>With warm wishes,<br>Lizzy Rockwell</p><h2>Wish Upon a Sleepover</h2><p><p><b>Bestselling author Suzanne Selfors brings heart and humor to <i>Wish Upon a Sleepover</i>, a middle-grade novel about a group of misfits who find true friendship where they least expect it.</b><br><b></b><br>Five misfits.

Wolf is still sticking to his story: he was framed! As for that huffing and puffing stuff? A big lie. A. Wolf was just trying to borrow a cup of sugar to make his poor old granny a birthday cake.<br><br> Who should you believe, the pigs or the wolf? You read. You decide.<br><br> A quarter-century after publication, with over two million copies sold, <i>The True Story of the Three Little Pigs</i> remains as funny and irreverent as the inventive minds of Jon Scieszka and Lane Smith. Viking is celebrating this landmark anniversary with a handsome gift edition, featuring a stunning new jacket with lots of silver. And there's a surprise inside as well!</p><p>Did the story of the three little pigs ever seem slightly biased to you? All that huffing and puffing--could one wolf really be so unequivocally evil? Finally, we get to hear the rest of the story, "as told to author Jon Scieszka," straight from the wolf's mouth. As Alexander T. Wolf explains it, the whole Big Bad Wolf thing was just a big misunderstanding. Al Wolf was minding his own business, making his granny a cake, when he realized he was out of a key ingredient. He innocently went from house to house to house (one made of straw, one of sticks, and one of bricks) asking to borrow a cup of sugar. Could he help it if he had a bad cold, causing him to sneeze gigantic, gale-force sneezes? Could he help it if pigs these days use shabby construction materials? And after the pigs had been ever-so-accidentally killed, well, who can blame him for having a snack? <p> As with <i>The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales</i>, (another stellar collaboration by Scieszka and illustrator Lane Smith), children who know all the old stories by heart will delight in reading impudent new versions. Here, Scieszka's text is clever, savvy, and tabloid-quick, and Smith's stretchy-strange illustrations complete this funny, irreverent, thoroughly original tale. <i>(Ages 4 to 8)</i></p>"There has obviously been some kind of mistake," writes Alexander T. Wolf from the pig penitentiary where he's doing time for his alleged crimes of 10 years ago. Here is the "real" story of the three little pigs whose houses are huffed and puffed to smithereens... from the wolf's perspective. This poor, much maligned wolf has gotten a bad rap. He just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, with a sneezy cold, innocently trying to borrow a cup of sugar to make his granny a cake. Is it his fault those ham dinners--rather, pigs--build such flimsy homes? Sheesh. <p> This 10th-anniversary edition of Jon Scieszka's New York Times Best Book of the Year, <i>The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs!</i>, includes a special, impassioned letter from prisoner A. Wolf himself and a snappy new jacket by Caldecott Honor artist Lane Smith, whose quirky perspectives still color the illustrations throughout. As with <i>The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales</i>, the collaborators take a classic story and send it through the wisecracker machine, much to the glee of kids young and old.

The cheekily charming tot goes through a typical nightly routine in a humorous bedtime book.</b><br><br>Dinner is finished, the sun is setting, and Baby is getting ready for bed, sneaking in a naked dance before bath time. Then it&#x2019;s on to tooth cleaning, hair brushing, bear hugging, and getting cozy in PJs. Finally it&#x2019;s time for a bedtime story (&#x201c;Again!

Kissy kissy!</p><p><b>Leslie Patricelli </b>is the creator of a series of best-selling board books starring her beloved (almost) bald baby as well as <i>Higher! Higher!; Faster! Faster!; Be Quiet, Mike!; </i>and two stories about the Patterson Puppies. She lives in Ketchum, Idaho.Baby-Toddler&#x2014;Patricelli's irrepressible baby is back for another wonderful board book installment. This title features the usual humorous tone mingled with the comforting routines of bedtime. After dinner, the baby bids farewell to the sun and says hello to the moon, before "Bye-bye pants. Naked dance!" The precious narrative speaks directly to the intended audience in language they are sure to respond to: "Brushy toothy. Brushy hair. Kissy Daddy. Huggy bear." In another context, this technique could be cloying, but the simplicity of the words, combined with the spare, appealing illustrations, makes for a harmonious read. After pajamas, a story, a song, and a final hug and kiss from both parents, the baby goes "nighty-night." VERDICT A highly recommended addition to all board book collections and a worthy companion to the other entries in the series.&#x2014;Kristy Pasquariello, Wellesley Free Library, MA</p><h2>Wild Winter Creatures!

Now, if you&#x2019;re reading this, I&#x2019;m guessing you&#x2019;re either too pathetic to pick up girls on your own, or you&#x2019;re looking for some creative ideas to spice up your repertoire&#x2014;but my money&#x2019;s on &#x201c;too pathetic to pick up girls on your own.&#x201d;<br> <br>You stumble up to a woman and stammer in a rehearsed yet cracking voice, &#x201c;Can I get your number?&#x201d; Your trembling hands are stuffed in your pockets in a futile attempt to look cool. You&#x2019;re dressed like an overgrown eighth grader. You&#x2019;re a little out of shape. Geez, buddy, you&#x2019;re kind of a mess, huh? Ooh, I bet you smell too.<br> <br>The good news is you&#x2019;re not alone, Ted. There are millions of unattractive chumps just like you all over the place who apparently never want to sleep with a woman. But all of that is going to change because now, with the help of The Playbook, you&#x2019;ll be able to approach any beautiful woman you want and trick her into sleeping with you. How? By giving you self-confidence and proving that you really are somebody who matters (even though you&#x2019;re not).<br> <br>Again, sincerely, thanks for purchasing this book.<br><br><b><b>WHAT IS <i>THE PLAYBOOK</i>?</b></b><br><br><i>The Playbook</i> provides a plenitude of plays to profit the persistent player. Contained within these pages are every scam, con, hustle, hoodwink, gambit, flimflam, stratagem, and bamboozle I&#x2019;ve ever used or ever hope to use to pick up chicks and give them the business. Now, in an act of selfless charity, I&#x2019;m passing this treasure of pleasure on to you as an easy-to-follow guide.<br><br>Included in this collection are more than seventy-five schemes that are guaranteed to attract all kinds of women, no matter how sorrowful your social skills are. Best of all, most of the plays require no experience and little to no preparation, so you have almost everything you need to get started right away. Almost: 83% of the plays will necessitate at least a few yards of aluminum foil, so before you get cracking you&#x2019;d be wise to buy in bulk at your local big-box store or discount warehouse retailer.<br><br>With so many other pickup programs available on the market today, you might be wondering what makes <i>The Playbook</i> unique. First of all, I created this program, so you know it&#x2019;s gonna be awesome. Second, I&#x2019;ve slept with enough hotties to overbook a commercial airliner (several of them <i>on</i> a commercial airliner, what up?) and only once had to wear eyeliner and a goofy hat to do it ... and that was only because this chick had been in a coma since 1983 and pretending to be Boy George was such an obvious layup.<br><br>Last, and most important, other seduction methods preach &#x201c;social dynamics&#x201d; in which you insult women in an attempt to attract them. I find that approach both demeaning and offensive. Rather than degrade women, <i>The Playbook</i> centers on the profound, positive, and personal changes <i>you</i> can make to trick hot sluts into sleeping with you.<br><br><b><b>HOW DOES <i>THE PLAYBOOK</i> WORK?</b></b><br><br>The plays in this book are scientifically calibrated to excite the female sex nodes enough to make her actually consider having sex with a stranger. This strategy flies in the face of conventional wisdom, because for countless millennia men were led to believe that women were not interested in casual sex. We were told their libido had been replaced with the urge to have children, make dinner, and discover the planet&#x2019;s cutest handbag. But recent evidence suggests that women enjoy sex almost as much as finding a Christian Dior clutch in white croc at 30% off.<br><br>Now, thanks to science, we can generate a clearer picture of what women are looking for in a sexual partner. After years of in-depth field research (<i>very</i> in-depth), I&#x2019;ve discovered that women are sexually aroused by four primary factors:<br><ol><li><br>Money<br></li><li><br>Fame<br></li><li><br>Vulnerability<br></li><li><br>Emotional and spiritual fulfillment<br></li></ol><br>Obviously, number four is right out the window. Seducing a woman by satisfying her on an emotional level is difficult, time-consuming, and quite frankly, unrewarding.<br><br>Therefore <i>The Playbook</i> focuses on transforming you into someone who reflects some or all of those first three qualities. If you&#x2019;re wondering why you have to change who you are, consider this: is a woman more likely to sleep with a loser like you or an underwater bomb diffuser who grew up in an orphanage? It&#x2019;s just science.<br><br>Using all this information, here&#x2019;s a composite sketch of what women might consider the most sexually attractive man ever.<br><br>Don&#x2019;t worry, <i>The Playbook</i> will never ask you to dress up like this bozo. You&#x2019;ll be asked to dress up like a fireman or a football player but never at the same time.<br><br><b><b>HOW TO USE <i>THE PLAYBOOK</i></b></b><br><br>As you flip through <i>The Playbook</i> you&#x2019;ll notice that each play is presented in an easy-to-follow recipe format. This is done so that even a chump like you has a shot at glory. Immediately following the title of the play is a profile box that presents the following quick reference information:<br><ol><li><br><b>Success Rate&#x2014;</b> the likelihood of &#x201c;completing&#x201d; the play<br></li><li><br><b>Attracts&#x2014;</b>the type of chick the play is designed to ensnare<br></li><li><br><b>Requirements&#x2014;</b>the props and/or special talents you&#x2019;ll need<br></li><li><br><b>Prep Time&#x2014;</b>how much time you need to invest in the play<br></li><li><br><b>Bummers&#x2014;</b>potential negatives to running the play, other than &#x201c;might totally fail&#x201d;<br></li></ol><br>Following the profile box are the numbered steps for each play. Simply follow them word for word with absolutely no deviation and you&#x2019;ll get laid. Maybe.<br><br>Now, before you flip to a page and start trying out plays on random chicks, there are three things you need to consider.<br><br><b><b>LOCATION. LOCATION. LOCATION.</b></b><br><br>While most plays can be performed at a party or in your local bar, I recommend you workshop these plays elsewhere when you&#x2019;re just getting your feet wet&#x2014;if you have any hope of getting other areas wet. Beta-testing a play in a foreign environment safeguards you from any emotional damage, physical harm, or heaven forbid, your bros giving you crap for striking out.<br><br><b><b>MAD PROPS</b></b><br><br>Some of the plays entail wardrobe elements or other accessories that might not be readily available about the home. Therefore it&#x2019;s a good idea to establish a relationship with a local party or costume shop owner. A good one will let you sample their wares at little to no cost if you promise to promptly return them. As a show of appreciation and good faith you should take extra care not to damage the costume, even as you&#x2019;re climbing out the window of a girl you just duped into sleeping with you. It&#x2019;s called integrity.<br><br><b><b>SKILL LEVEL</b></b><br><br>Some of the plays require a considerable amount of game while others entail almost no effort whatsoever ... like The Michael Jordan or The Saudi Prince. <i>The Playbook</i> presents plays in increasing order of difficulty so that you can take baby steps on your way to baby-making steps&#x2122;.

In fact, devising schemes to seduce women has been man&#x2019;s primary occupation since before the dawn of history. The proof exists in prehistoric cave paintings.<br><br>Cavemen would return home from a hunt carrying one of their buddies, Urk, on their shoulders. They would describe through spirited reenactment what a &#x201c;dangerous&#x201d; kill it was and how Urk bravely climbed atop the saber-toothed tiger or mastodon or triceratops or whatever. To help sell the story, they drew pictures of the event on the wall using charcoal and ochre.<br><br>Thanks to his bros, Urk would score some major cave tail that night while the others played &#x201c;rock rock rock&#x201d; to decide who would be the next day&#x2019;s hero (Urk became ineligible for a week). On the next hunt the men would quickly kill an animal and then spend the rest of the day choreographing the big reenactment and arguing over which cave chicks would look the best clothed. Creating the myth of the all-day hunt served two purposes for cavemen: it got one guy some easy action and got the rest out of a full day of gathering and nagging.<br><br>While The Hero of the Hunt is as old as The I Discovered Fire, it&#x2019;s actually not the oldest trick in the book. That would be The I Love You&#x2014;which of course had an extra level of complexity before the invention of language.<br><br>Surprisingly, the next attempt to record plays didn&#x2019;t occur until the thirteenth century, when monks spent their entire lives writing down seduction scenarios in collections called illuminated manuscripts. Tragically, they were all destroyed by a gaggle of angry nuns.<br><br><i>But, Barney, why would monks spend their entire lives scheming up ways to sleep with women when they had taken a vow of celibacy?</i><br><br>I think you just answered your own question, fake reader.<br><b> FAMOUS PLAYS THROUGHOUT HISTORY </b>The Royal BurialKing Tut1323 BC&#x201c;Dies&#x201d; young and is entombed with tons of gold: the original chick magnet.The Great Last NameAlexander the Great325 BCConquers much of the known world, creating a legion of angry fathers in order to become the ultimate &#x201c;bad boy.&#x201d;The QuetzalcoatlHern�n Cort�s1519Convinces women of the Aztec Empire that he&#x2019;s a god by showing them his shiny helmet.The Insignificant HumanGalileo Galilei1610Points his telescope heavenward, proving to chicks how infinitesimal we are, so why not bang?The Great CompromiseRoger Sherman1787Develops the bicameral system of representation to balance power between large and small states but, more important, triple the number of hot young staffers introduced to Washington, DC, every election cycle.The Me ComplexNapoleon1811Generates sympathy among countless European chicks by convincing them he conquered half the continent because he&#x2019;s ashamed of his height.The Spirit of St. LouisCharles Lindbergh1927Fools the world into thinking flying is dangerous, thereby creating generations of nervous and vulnerable female passengers.

From morning sickness and hormonal rage, to hemorrhoids, granny panties, pregnant sex, and the torture and sweet relief that is delivery, <i>Belly Laughs</i> is must-read comic relief for anyone who is pregnant, has ever been pregnant, is trying to get pregnant, or, indeed, has ever been born!</p><p>Jenny McCarthy is the author of ten books, including the <i>New York Times </i>bestsellers <i>Belly Laughs</i> and <i>Baby Laughs</i>. Getting her start as the host of MTV's hugely popular dating show Singled Out, McCarthy has had a high-profile television and film career and has been a guest on virtually every television talk show, from <i>The Oprah Winfrey Show</i>, <i>Larry King Live</i>, T<i>he View</i>, <i>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</i>, <i>Late Show with David Letterman</i>, and more.McCarthy, 1994 Playmate of the Year, actress (<i>Scream 3</i>; <i>Baywatch</i>; etc.) and former host of MTV's <i>Singled Out</i>, gave birth to her first child in 2002. Her pregnancy wasn't pretty&#x2014;and she wants to tell readers all about it. At the outset, she tells them, "If you bought this book, you are already aware of my frankness when it comes to certain things&#x2014;anatomy and bodily functions among them. If someone gave this book to you as a gift and you've never heard of me, apologies to you!" She goes on to recount the nitty-gritty of pregnancy in all its gory detail, covering morning sickness, hormonal rage, cravings, hemorrhoids, "engorged" breasts, gas, hot flashes, fainting spells, weight gain, acne, water retention and, finally, labor. McCarthy is undeniably crass but funny, and her candor and self-deprecation are refreshing. Each brief, chatty chapter focuses on a different&#x2014;and awful&#x2014;facet of pregnancy, with McCarthy relating personal anecdotes and usually winding down by reassuring women they're not alone. McCarthy's tales are, for the most part, a hoot, though they may offend more uptight readers. For example, in the beginning of McCarthy's pregnancy, she was constipated, so she visited a specialist. In the waiting room, the assistant called her name, and "everyone... looked up in surprise, and I knew what they were thinking: 'Jenny McCarthy has butt hole problems?' I was so embarrassed, until I realized that they had no right to be smirking: Those assholes were also there because of their own assholes. I felt better already."<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Salma, the daughter of migrant workers, is in the small town with her family for the blueberry-picking season. <br><br>After their initial chance meeting, Salma and Lily bond over painting bee boxes for Lily's grandfather, and Salma's friendship transforms Lily's summer.

Lily lives in Maine, raised by her maternal grandparents, M�m�re and P�p�re. Her black lab, Lucky, is her strongest connection to her deceased mother. Lucky is slowly going blind and Lily is determined to raise money for an expensive and risky eye surgery to cure him; she paints wooden mason bee houses and sells them in her grandparent's general store. Salma is in Maine for the summer with her family, migrant workers who live and work in the blueberry barrens. Lucky unexpectedly brings the girls together and they immediately bond over their love of dogs, art, and blueberry enchiladas. Salma is creative and artistic, something that Lily both admires and envies. When Salma decides to enter the Blueberry Queen pageant&#x2014;something no migrant girl has ever done before&#x2014;Lily's eyes are opened to the microaggressions of some of the townsfolk. There's also the surprising support from Hannah, Lily's former best friend and reigning Blueberry Queen, who offers to loan Salma a gown. Through her friendship with Salma, the protagonist finds a confidence she didn't know she had and she begins to recognize and question her own previously unexamined biases. Despite the slim page count, this middle grade novel's plot evolves organically. Lord's characters reveal themselves slowly within the narrative and the Maine setting is richly described. The bright cover featuring an adorable black lab is pure shelfbait; though readers looking for a animal tale will instead find a story that centers more on family, friendship, and growing pains.

Workbooks and Spanish editions are also available.</p></p><p>In order to call themselves good Christians, many people have drawn overly flexible boundaries (unwilling to say no, always accommodating others' needs) or overly rigid boundaries (to the point of being righteous and judgmental). Psychologists and inspirational speakers Cloud and Townsend show readers how to set reasonable boundaries in order to follow the true path of Christianity. This book has become immensely popular, most likely because it makes personal boundaries easier to define and is filled with spiritual purpose. Some cautions: the format can be overly self-helpish for such a complex discussion and the authors at one point imply that judicious spankings may be an acceptable form of setting boundaries with children. However, many Christians will probably find themselves grateful for this biblical context of boundaries. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>Since its release in 1992, Boundaries--the definitive book on healthy human relations by Drs.

An international bestseller since it was first published in 1972, Dr. Alex Comfort&#x2019;s classic work dared to celebrate the joy of human physical intimacy with such authority and candor that a whole generation felt empowered to enjoy sex. Now fully updated, revised, and reillustrated, <i>The Joy of Sex</i> once again sets the standard as the world&#x2019;s most trusted sex manual. <br><br> Substantial revisions from sex expert and relationship psychologist Susan Quilliam include new information on:<br><br> � Key scientific discoveries in the fields of psychology, physiology, and sexology<br> � The Internet and couple-friendly pornography<br> � The importance of sex to our growth as people and partners<br> � Maintaining a fulfilling sex life as we get older<br><br> Above all, <i>The Joy of Sex </i>emphasizes the importance of happy and healthy sexuality in our lives.</p><p><b>DR. ALEX COMFORT</b> was one of the world&#x2019;s leading experts in the field of human sexuality and one of the most versatile authors of the twentieth century. He died in March 2000 at the age of eighty.<br><br><b> SUSAN QUILLIAM</b> is a relationship psychologist and an advice columnist. She writes, broadcasts, and presents internationally on topics surrounding love and sexuality.<b>On Gourmet Lovemaking <br></b> All of us, barring any physical limitations, are able to dance and sing &#x2014; after a fashion. This, if you think about it, summarizes the justification for learning to make love. Love, in the same way as singing, is something to be taken spontaneously. On the other hand, the difference between Pavlova and the Palais de Danse, or opera and barbershop singing, is much less than the difference between sex as our recent ancestors came to accept it and sex as it can be. <br> At least we recognize this now (so that instead of worrying if sex is sinful, most people now worry whether they are &#x201c;getting satisfaction&#x201d; &#x2014; one can worry about anything, given the determination). And there are now enough books about the basics; we are largely past the point of people worrying about the nor�mality, possibility, and variety of sexual experience. This book is slightly differ�ent, in that there are now enough people who have those basics and want more depth of understanding, solid ideas, and inspiration. <br> To draw a parallel, chef-grade cooking doesn&#x2019;t happen naturally: it starts at the point where people know how to prepare and enjoy food, are curious about it and willing to take trouble preparing it, read recipe hints, and find they are helped by one or two techniques. It&#x2019;s hard to make mayonnaise by trial and error, for instance. Gourmet sex, as we define it, is the same &#x2014; the extra one can get from comparing notes, using some imagination, trying way-out or new experi�ences, when one already is making satisfying love and wants to go on from there. <br> This book will likely attract four sorts of readers. First, there are those who don&#x2019;t fancy it, find it disturbing, and would rather stay the way they are &#x2014; these should put it down, accept our apologies, and stay the way they are. Second, there are those who are with the idea, but don&#x2019;t like our choice of techniques &#x2014; remember, it&#x2019;s a menu, not a rulebook. <br> Third, most people will use our notes as a personal one-couple notebook from which they might get ideas. In this respect we have tried to stay wide open. One of the original aims of this book was to cure the notion, born of non-discussion, that common sex needs are odd or weird; the whole joy of sex-with�love is that there are no rules, so long as you enjoy, and the choice is practically unlimited. We have, however, left out long discussion of very specialized sexual preferences; people who like these know already what they want to try. <br>The final group of readers are the hardy experimentalists, bent on trying absolutely everything. They too will do best to read this exactly like a cookbook &#x2014; except that sex is safer in this respect, between lovers, in that you can&#x2019;t get obese or atherosclerotic on it, or give yourself ulcers. The worst you can get, given sensible safety precautions, is sore, anxious, or disappointed. However, one needs a steady basic diet of quiet, loving, night-and-morning intercourse to stand this experimentation on, simply because, contrary to popular ideas, the more regular sex a couple has, the higher the deliberately contrived peaks &#x2014; just as the more you cook routinely, the better and the more reliable banquets you can stage. <br>One specific group of readers deserves special note. If you are disabled in any way, don&#x2019;t stop reading. A physical disability is not an obstacle to fulfilling sex. In counseling disabled people, one repeatedly finds that the real disability isn&#x2019;t a mechanical problem but a mistaken idea that there is only one &#x201c;right&#x201d; &#x2014; or enjoyable &#x2014; way to have sex. The best approach is probably to go through the book with your partner, marking off the things you can do. Then pick some�thing appealing that you think you can&#x2019;t quite do, and see if there is a strategy you can develop together. Talking to other couples where one partner has a problem similar to yours is another resource. <br>In sum, the people we are addressing are the adventurous and uninhibited lovers who want to find the limits of their ability to enjoy sex. That means we take some things for granted &#x2014; having intercourse naked and spending time over it; being able and willing to make it last, up to a whole afternoon on occasion; having privacy; not being scared of things like genital kisses; not being obsessed with one sexual trick to the exclusion of all others; and, of course, loving each other. <br>As the title implies, this book is about love as well as sex: you don&#x2019;t get high-quality sex on any other basis &#x2014; either you love each other before you come to want it, or, if you happen to get it, you love each other because of it, or both. Just as you can&#x2019;t cook without heat, you can&#x2019;t make love without feedback. By feedback, we mean the right mixture of stop and go, tough and tender, exertion and affection. This comes by empathy and long mutual knowledge. Anyone who expects to get this in a first attempt with a stranger is an optimist, or a neu�rotic &#x2014; if they do, it&#x2019;s what used to be called love at first sight, and isn&#x2019;t expend�able: &#x201c;skill,&#x201d; or variety, is no substitute. Also, one can&#x2019;t teach tenderness. <br>The starting point of all lovemaking is close bodily contact; love has been defined as the harmony of two souls, and the contact of two epiderms. At the same time, we might as well plan our menu so that we learn to use the rest of our equipment. That includes our feelings of identity, forcefulness, and so on, and all of our fantasy needs. Luckily, sex behavior in humans is enormously elastic (it has had to be, or we wouldn&#x2019;t be here), and also nicely geared to help us express most of the needs that society or our upbringing have corked up. <br>Elaboration in sex is something we need rather specially and it has the advantage that if we really make it work, it makes us more, not less, receptive to each other as people. This is the answer to anyone who thinks that con�scious effort to increase our sex range is &#x201c;mechanical&#x201d; or a substitute for real human relationship &#x2014; we may start that way, but it&#x2019;s an excellent entry to learning that we are people and relating to each other as such. There may be other places we can learn to express all of ourselves, and do it mutually, but there aren&#x2019;t many. <br>Those are the assumptions on which this book is based. Granted this, there are two modes of sex &#x2014; the duet and the solo &#x2014; and a good concert alternates between the two. The duet is a cooperative effort aiming at simultaneous orgasm, or at least one orgasm each, and complete, untechnically planned release. This, in fact, needs skill, and can be built up from more calculated &#x201c;love�play&#x201d; until doing the right thing for both of you becomes fully automatic. This is the basic sexual meal. <br>The solo, by contrast, is when one partner is the player and the other the instrument. The aim of the player is to produce results on the other&#x2019;s pleasure experience as extensive, unexpected, and generally wild as his or her skill allows &#x2014; to blow them out of themselves. The player doesn&#x2019;t lose control, though he or she can get wildly excited by what is happening to the other. The instrument does lose control &#x2014; in fact, with a responsive instrument and a skillful performer, this is the concerto situation &#x2014; and if it ends in an uncontrollable ensemble, so much the better. All the elements of music and dance are involved &#x2014; rhythm, mounting tension, tantalization, even forcefulness: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m like the executioner,&#x201d; said the lady in the Persian poem, &#x201c;but where he inflicts intolerable pain I will only make you die of pleasure.&#x201d; There is indeed an element of infliction in the solo mode, which is why some lovers dislike it and others overdo it, but no major lovemaking is complete without some solo passages. <br>The antique idea of the woman as passive and the man as performer used to ensure that he would show off playing solos on her, and early marriage manuals perpetuated this idea. Today, she is herself the soloist par excellence, whether in getting him excited to start with, or in controlling him and showing off all her skills. Solo recitals are not, of course, necessarily separate from intercourse. Apart from leading into it, there are many coital solos &#x2014; for the woman astride, for example &#x2014; while mutual masturbation or genital kisses can be fully fledged duets. Solo response can be electrifyingly extreme in the quietest people. Skillfully handled by someone who doesn&#x2019;t stop for yells of murder but does know when to stop, a woman can get orgasm after orgasm, and a man can be kept hanging just short of climax to the limit of human endurance. The solo-given orgasm, whether from her or from him, is unique &#x2014; neither bigger nor smaller in either sex than a full duet but different; sharper but not so round. And most people who have experienced both like to alternate them. Trying to say how they differ is a little like describing wine. Differ they do, however, and much depends on cultivating and alternating them. <br>Top-level enjoyment doesn&#x2019;t have to be varied, it just often is. In fact, being stuck rigidly with one sex technique usually means anxiety. In this book we have not, for example, focused on coital postures to the exclusion of all else. The common positions are now familiar to most people from writing and pic�tures if not from trial &#x2014; the more extreme ones, as a rule, should be sponta�neous, but few of them have marked advantages. This explains the apparent emphasis in this book on extras &#x2014; the &#x201c;sauces and pickles.&#x201d; That said, individu�als who, through a knot in their psyche, are obliged to live on sauce and pickle only are unfortunate in missing the most sustaining part of the meal &#x2014; exclu�sive obsessions in sex are very like living exclusively on horseradish sauce through allergy to beef; fear of horseradish sauce, however, as indigestible, unnecessary, and immature is another hang-up, namely puritanism. <br>One of the things still missing from the essence of sexual freedom is the unashamed ability to use sex as play. In the past, ideas of maturity were nearly as much to blame as old-style moralisms about what is normal or perverse. We are all immature, and have anxieties and aggressions. Coital play, like dreaming, may be a programmed way of dealing acceptably with these, just as children express their fears and aggressions in games. Adults are unfortunately afraid of playing games, dressing up, and acting scenes. It makes them self-conscious: something horrid might get out. In this regard, bed is the place to play all the games you have ever wanted to play &#x2014; if adults could become less self-conscious about such &#x201c;immature&#x201d; needs, we should have fewer deeply anxious people. If we were able to transmit the sense of play that is essential to a full, enterprising, and healthily immature view of sex between committed people, we would be performing a mitzvah: playfulness is a part of love that could be a major contribution to human happiness. <br>But still the main dish is loving, un-self-conscious sexual pleasure of all kinds &#x2014; long, frequent, varied, ending with both parties satisfied, but not so full they can&#x2019;t face another light course, and another meal in a few hours. The pi�ce de r�sistance is good old face-to-face matrimonial, the finishing-off position, with mutual orgasm, and starting with a full day or night of ordinary tenderness. Other ways of making love are special in various ways, and the changes of timbre are infinitely varied &#x2014; complicated ones are for special occasions, or special uses like holding off an over-quick male orgasm, or are things that, like pepper steak, are stunning once a year but not staples. <br>There are, after all, only two &#x201c;rules&#x201d; in good sex, apart from the obvious one of not doing things that are silly, antisocial, or dangerous. One is: &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do anything you don&#x2019;t really enjoy,&#x201d; and the other is: &#x201c;Find out your partner&#x2019;s needs and don&#x2019;t balk at them if you can help it.&#x201d; In other words, a good giving and taking relationship depends on a compromise (so does going to a show &#x2014; if you both want the same thing, fine; if not, take turns and don&#x2019;t let one partner always dictate). This can be easier than it sounds, because unless their partner wants something they find actively off-putting, real lovers get a reward not only from their own satisfaction but also from seeing the other respond and become satisfied. Most wives who don&#x2019;t like Chinese food will eat it occasionally for the pleasure of seeing a Sinophile husband enjoy it, and vice versa.</p><h2>The Divine Mentor: Growing Your Faith as You Sit at the Feet of the Savior</h2><p>Many believers settle for a spiritual routine that lacks God&#39;s presence. But what they truly want, and truly need, is a dynamic, vital, and intimate relationship with God. Here Wayne Cordeiro gently but directly shows readers how to move from routine to relationship--from mundane actions to fresh encounters--by learning to hear Him speak to them through the Bible. Through stories, lessons, and anecdotes, Cordeiro equips readers to listen to the promptings of the Holy Spirit as they read God&#39;s Word, enabling them to transform their daily quiet time with the Lord.</p><p>"When it comes to diving into the Book and letting God talk to me through its message, no one has mentored me more than Wayne Cordeiro." --Bill Hybels, Senior Pastor, Willow Creek Community Church "Wayne Cordeiro's message and ministry are a gift to the kingdom of God. I'm confident his book will be an encouragement to all who read it." --Max Lucado, bestselling author <p>"The principles and practices Wayne develops in The Divine Mentor are not just theory. They have revolutionized my walk with God and are transforming the lives of many in the church I lead." --Jorge Acevedo, Lead Pastor, Grace Church, Cape Coral, Florida </p><p>"Wayne's SOAP method of devotions and journaling has provided me with a systematic, disciplined method of hearing from God daily. It has transformed my life and, more importantly, I have seen the transformation of many people in the life of the church who utilize this approach to devotions." --Mark Edwards, Senior Minister, Ipswich Region Community Church, Queensland, Australia</p>Wayne Cordeiro is a senior pastor of New Hope Christian Fellowship in Honolulu, Hawaii, one of the nation&#39;s fastest growing churches. Pioneered by him, it has grown to over 12,000 in weekend attendance since 1995, with many attendees being first-time Christians. Wayne is an author, songwriter, and highly sought-after conference speaker. His books include Doing Church as a Team, Attitudes That Attract Success, and The Divine Mentor. His speaking takes him around the world. He is a church planter at heart and has helped to plant 83 churches in the Pacific Rim.

She conducts original field investigations of haunted and mysterious sites, and researches entity contact experiences and spirit communications. Her work has been featured in documentaries and docu-dramas on the History Channel, the Travel Channel, SyFy, the Discovery Channel, A&amp;E, and Animal Planet, as well as independent productions. She is a frequent guest on Coast to Coast AM with George Noory. Guiley is a consulting editor of FATE Magazine and a frequent lecturer across the country. She lives in Connecticut.With more than 400 entries and 80 black-and-white photos, this resource explores what many believe are the sources of evil&#x2014;demons or devils. Demons, as defined here, are &#x201c;lower agents of evil,&#x201d; having many guises and operating under many names with many purposes. The book does a fine job of walking the reader through all the mythology; if readers are looking for a strictly Christian interpretation of demonology, it&#x2019;s not here. Key topics include the types of demons and history of demonology, possession and historical cases, today&#x2019;s demonologists and exorcists, forms and means of confronting demons, and demons in popular culture, different cultures, and many religious traditions. Entries are organized A&#x2013;Z, and most conclude with a short title list of further reading. Additionally, a concise, unannotated bibliography is included at the end of the work. Guiley is a leading authority and author on numerous paranormal topics and has appeared on TV and radio shows. She feels everyone needs to be informed about demons, and with this title, she wants to &#x201c;open further avenues of inquiry on the subject of the dark side.&#x201d; The work is a thorough reference on an arcane subject and is valuable for its many historical accounts of demons or devils and their arts. Guiley is sometimes criticized for her lack of skepticism, but she has produced a helpful resource for readers who need an overview. It will be used in public and academic libraries by patrons who are interested in demonology. --Susan Awe</p><h2>Cityblock (An Abrams Block Book)</h2><p><i>Cityblock</i> explores city life in an exciting and unique way, from up in a high-rise building to down in the subway.

Take my word for it--in the long run, none of them work. Well, obviously they didn't work, or you wouldn't be reading this book. Or maybe they worked for a week or two before your weight boomeranged back to its usual (depressing) number on the scale, but the end result is the same: You think you're doing everything right, and you still can't lose the weight. And after a while, you become discouraged--and why wouldn't you?<br><br>Why does nothing you've tried work? You've attempted so many diets that you can no longer open your refrigerator door without feeling a massive headache clamp down. There is SO much competing information out there, and so many contradictory recommendations, that it's no wonder we no longer have any idea what we're supposed to eat or how we're supposed to move. Eat low carb. Eat no carbs. Eat ALL carbs. . . . Who could possibly make sense of all these competing prescriptions?<br><br>Did you know that more than half of Americans, an astonishing 52 percent, think it's easier to do their own income taxes than to figure out how to eat healthier? That's right, filing with the IRS has suddenly become preferable to knowing what you should have for lunch.1<br><br>Let me tell you: It's time to stop. Enough is enough! We are listening to the wrong people telling us to do the wrong things. Who are these authorities, anyway? A lot of the TV trainers we're letting guide our fitness decisions are straight out of central casting (and I mean literally straight out of central casting) meaning they have zero credentials in the field of nutrition and have never trained anyone in their lives before their first television appearance.<br><br>I had the privilege of hosting a talk-show called <i>The Revolution</i>, which was one of the most rewarding experiences of my professional career. The amazing women I met helped me rethink my whole weight-loss philosophy. Even with 10 years of education and 20 years in my practice, I needed to change my way of thinking. That's a lot more than I can say about most of the high- profile "experts" who are dictating the health decisions too many people are making.<br><br>It's my training, and the wide range of people whose bodies and minds I've helped transform over the past 20 years, from Halle Berry and Jessica Simpson to single-mom schoolteachers, that has led me to understand exactly how serious the crisis we're facing is. Let me tell you, I know exactly what you're going through, whether you need to lose a ton of weight, or those last stubborn 5 �ds, and you have no idea where to begin. That's what I'm here for. Stick with me for the next 15 days and you will see amazing, dramatic results--in your energy level, in your health, and most noticeably in your weight.<br><br>To get there, first we have to wipe the slate clean. Press reset. Start over. Rethink everything you've ever been told about how to lose weight. People are looking to crazier diet solutions than ever, and where is it getting them? Right back where they started from--maybe even a few �ds heavier. So before you embark on your next crazy scheme, let me explain why you keep failing, and why you can see far more dramatic results from a much simpler and more sensible approach.<br><br>Trust me, I realize what I'm up against because I know exactly how much crazy stuff is out there. I admit that some of the better-known, more mainstream programs--with point systems and so forth--can be effective, but in many cases they take too long for the kind of results people want (and deserve), and some are also prohibitively expensive.<br><br>So people turn to the more extreme quick fixes, everything from eating like a caveman to inserting feeding tubes in their arms and living off nothing but liquids in IV form for weeks on end. I mean--are you serious? Losing weight does not have to resemble an all-out death wish.<br><br>The caveman lived on nuts and meats alone, but he also stayed active all day long and--oh, yeah--he generally died by age 18! In all other ways, our lives are hardly Paleolithic: We pop countless pills in the hopes of losing a few �ds here and there. Weight-loss pills are a $2.4 billion industry in the United States, despite a recent study determining that no evidence exists that any single product will result in significant weight loss.2 Even sketchier is that some bodybuilding and weight-loss pills have been shown to cause liver damage, among other serious health issues.3<br><br>Weight-loss pills are often unregulated and can be quite dangerous. From 1999 to 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) received 32 reports of serious liver damage in people taking orlistat, the active ingredient in Alli weight-loss pills; 27 patients were hospitalized and six cases resulted in liver failure. The FDA says it's not completely clear if orlistat caused the liver damage and is not telling people taking Xenical or Alli to stop using the weight-loss pills. But the agency warns them to be careful to use the medicine as directed.4 It's clear that using weight- loss pills can cause serious damage and just aren't worth the risk to your health.<br><br>What about attempting to cleanse your body of all those toxins that must surely be the sole reason for your bloat? Detox cleanses have gotten huge in recent years, propelled by promises of quick results and endorsed by top celebrities. But the days upon days of near-fasting recommended by these programs can have some seriously nasty side effects, including vitamin deficiencies, muscle breakdown, blood sugar problems, loose stool, and overall weakening of the body's immune system and ability to fight infection and inflammation. Excessive cleansing can also lead to the expulsion of "good bacteria," which are essential for keeping the intestines healthy and the whole immune system functioning properly.<br><br>When you're coping with all these issues--and I haven't even mentioned the headaches, irritability, fatigue, aches and pains, and dehydration--how are you supposed to carry on with the rest of your life, much less get the exercise you need to be healthy? And how can you possibly stay on any such extreme plan for more than a few agonizing days?<br><br>The answer is: You can't, and that's why you're reading this book. These quick fixes might help you squeeze back into your favorite jeans by Friday night, but they are wreaking major havoc on your health, and the results DO NOT LAST, for a whole multitude of reasons.<br><br>Here's where the yo-yo-ing comes in. You lose 15 pounds by surviving (barely) on grapefruits for a month, but then within hours of putting real food in your poor depleted body again, your weight immediately balloons up 20 �ds above your original starting point. How else is your poor confused metabolism supposed to react?<br><br>So let's give up all this crazy stuff. None of it works. It's just crazy.<br><br>They Require Too Much Time, Effort, or Money<br><br>Many diets, including some of the healthier, moderation-based plans, fail because they ask too much of the participants' time. Whether it's attending meetings during lunch hour, writing down and adding up every single bite of food consumed over the course of the day, or spending an hour of prep time per recipe five times a day, many of these diets make unreasonable demands on our already-crammed schedules. I just opened up a hot new diet cookbook and the first recipe I saw was for an omelet--with 12 ingredients! (P.S. I made it, and it was gross. Thanks for nothing, firefighter diet.) However noble their aims, these diets simply ask too much of us. Most of us are already juggling enough responsibilities as it is.<br><br>Learning how to eat efficiently and move effectively is not rocket science, but we've complicated everything so much that it's sometimes hard to see the forest for the trees. When you don't succeed on a diet, it's not because you're a fundamentally weak person; it's because you've set yourself up to fail with endless impossible restrictions and headache- inducing do-and-don't lists.<br><br>The other problem with diets tends to be price. They just cost too much. Getting ready-made meals delivered to your door might be convenient, but it sure isn't cheap. A recent study examined 10 of the most popular diets and found that their median cost was $85.79 per week, or roughly 58 percent more than the average $54.44 most Americans spend weekly on food. And some--like the Jenny Craig diet, which has an average cost of $137.65 per week--are even pricier still.5 One popular detox cleanse costs an eye-popping $195 for a 3-day supply of juice. That's almost $70 a day--a huge financial commitment for some seriously dubious rewards.<br><br>They Teach the Wrong Lessons About Food<br><br>Whether you're eating all juice, all cereal, or all red meat, eventually your palate will rebel against the monotony. It's perfectly natural for you to get sick of eating the exact same ingredient over and over again.<br><br>The more restrictive the diet, it seems, the more likely the weight loss is temporary. According to recent research published in American Psychologist, while people can lose 5 to 10 percent of their weight in the first few months of a diet, up to two-thirds of them regain even more weight than they lost within 4 or 5 years.6<br><br>Many diets ignore the fact that eating is one of the great pleasures in life by depriving dieters of a huge range of foods, and no one can possibly stay on such a limiting regimen for so long. It doesn't help that most foods on these programs don't taste good. When you're living off space-food- like prepackaged frozen entrees or raw kale salad all day, you're not going to look forward to your meals--and why would you? You eat this way because you want to lose weight, but after the first few days the very idea of another frozen chicken dish and/or bowl of steamed bok choy and watercress makes your stomach turn, and so you stray from your plan for one meal and then another, and before the week is up you're off the program altogether.<br><br>Other diets demand we hunt down hard-to-find, exotic ingredients--as if, if your local grocery store doesn't happen to carry organic free-range venison, quail eggs, or persimmons, your whole eating plan is doomed on Day 1.<br><br>They Confuse Some Basic Nutritional Facts<br><br>Some diet programs focus exclusively on the old "calories in, calories out" rule, the theory being that if you expend more calories than you take in, you will lose weight, period, end of story. But diets that focus exclusively on calories and not what those calories are made of are completely misguided. I cannot emphasize this point enough: Not all calories are created equal.<br><br>Fourteen hundred calories of white bread is NOT the equivalent of fourteen hundred calories of salmon. Different foods affect our bodies differently, regardless of caloric content. They make you look different and feel different, too.<br><br>A recent study found that following a low-fat diet can slow down your metabolism, which makes weight loss more difficult, whereas a high-protein diet can increase the body's fat-burning capabilities.7 Another found that low-fat diets are not the best route to lasting weight loss.8 So losing weight is not a simple matter of caloric arithmetic. You also have to consider WHAT you're eating, not just how much of it.<br><br>And far too often, diets deprive us not only of calories but of the foods we need to live at the top of our game. If, for example, you're on a juice fast, you're not getting ANY protein, healthy fats, or fiber--and your body needs all of these nutrients to function. Because you're depriving your body, you'll probably be hungry, miserable--and extremely vulnerable to falling off the wagon. We also don't take in enough liquids, and many of us live in a state of semidehydration, which our bodies far too often confuse for hunger, which causes us to eat more.<br><br>They Push Exercise Too Much<br><br>Never thought you'd hear that from a fitness professional, did you? But overexercising can be a real problem. First off, no amount of exercise can undo the effects of a bad diet. Do you know how many minutes you have to do on an elliptical trainer to offset the caloric burden of a single slice of cheesecake? Up to an hour and a half. And no studies have shown that exercise in and of itself definitively causes weight loss. As Gary Taubes put it in his well-argued book Why We Get Fat, "very little evidence exists to support the belief that the number of calories we expend"--i.e., how much we work out--"has any effect on how fat we are."9<br><br>I believe it's because our over-the-top workout habits end up supercharging our appetites, ultimately causing us to consume even more calories than we would have if we'd stayed home and skipped the gym. Taubes once again states the case plainly: "Increase the energy you expend and the evidence is very good that you will increase the calories you consume to compensate."10 Put in the simplest terms possible: The harder you work out, the hungrier you'll be, and the more you eat. But if you want to lose weight, increasing the number of calories you're taking in is counterproductive at best.<br><br>I started thinking about this seeming contradiction more and more in the summer of 2009, when Time published a cover story called "Why Exercise Won't Make You Thin."11 The gist was--hey, it's great that you go to the gym, but if you leave the gym famished and hit the all-you-can-eat buffet on your way home, you're still going to gain weight, simple as that.<br><br>But was it? Why have so many popular fitness programs failed to get this message? Turn on your TV and look at all the current exercise infomercials out there--ever tried working out with that drill sergeant shouting orders at you to do nearly impossible types of exercise at nearly impossible levels of intensity with no regard for possibility of injury? Many of these programs are way too difficult, way too intense, and there's just no method to the madness. I myself am in great shape and can't do most of these exercises! Why is there a program based on chinups when only a tiny percentage of the population can actually do these incredibly advanced exercises?</p><h2>Baking with Kim-Joy: Cute and Creative Bakes to Make You Smile</h2><p>Infuse your baking with a sprinkle of glitter, a rainbow of colors and a menagerie of woodland creatures with the help of this unique baking book from everyone's favorite Great British Bake Off finalist, Kim-Joy!<br><br>If you've ever wanted to know how to bring your baking to life, Kim-Joy will show you how in this fun and practical book.

England is in the grip of terror as strange, violent storms lash the countryside and the Witchbreed, beings with amazing powers, stalk the land - all the while persecuted by the Holy Inquisition! A host of Marvel heroes and villains including Spider-Man, the X-Men, Nick Fury, Doctor Strange, Captain America, Daredevil, Doctor Doom, Magneto and more emerge during the dark days of 1602 and are drawn into a plot of treason and treachery - whilst the end of the world seems nigh! Collecting 1602 #1-8.</p><p>Neil Gaiman is the #1 New York Times bestselling author of more than twenty books, and is the recipient of numerous literary honors. Originally from England, he now lives in America. <br> <br>Along with his brother Adam, Andy Kubert has followed in the comic footsteps of his legendary father, artist Joe Kubert. Together, Adam and Andy Kubert have drawn nearly every character in the Marvel Universe.Starred Review. The always inventive Gaiman has concocted an unlikely&#x2014;but fantastically successful&#x2014;superhero comic that transfers Marvel's classic characters to the Elizabethan period. Nick Fury is still a lethal government operative, but now he's an adviser to Queen Elizabeth. Her Majesty is equally reliant on magician and doctor Stephen Strange. X-Men mentor Charles Xavier still shepherds a band of mutant teens, only now he's called Carlos Javier, and the mutants are known, and mistrusted, as "witchbreed." Carlos's mysterious nemesis has taken on a new job: grand inquisitor of the Spanish Inquisition. Peter Parker (here "Parquah") is still a confused but well-meaning teenager who has yet to be bitten by a radioactive spider. Placed in a period landscape (rendered in rich, painterly panels by illustrator Kubert and digital painter Richard Isanove), these familiar characters must grapple with the issues of the day, chief among them the machinations of the evil King James of Scotland. And, in classic superhero style, they must save the world. The improbable combination works remarkably well, as the superheroes' strange abilities adapt to Elizabethan culture. This glorious adventure is peppered with Scott McKowen's gorgeous, moody cover-art woodcuts. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Rubina is mortified, but she can't convince Ami that you just don't bring your younger sister to your friend's party. So both girls go, and not only does Sana demand to win every game, but after the party she steals Rubina's prized party favor, a red lollipop. What's a fed-up big sister to do?<p>Rukhsana Khan's clever story and Sophie Blackall's irresistible illustrations make for a powerful combination in this fresh and surprising picture book.<br><br></p></p><p>Rukhsana Khan lives in Toronto, Canada.<br><br> Sophie Blackall lives in Brooklyn, New York.*Starred Review* Siblings everywhere will see themselves in this story, even though it is rooted in the experience of an immigrant family. Rubina is invited to a birthday party, and her little sister Sana screams, I wanna go too! Their mother, Ami, insists that Sana be taken along, despite Rubina&#x2019;s vigorous protests, and the party turns out as badly as Rubina worries it will. To add insult to injury, after eating the lollipop in her goody bag, Sana almost finishes off Rubina&#x2019;s. When Sana comes home with her own invitation to a birthday party, their littlest sister wants to attend, and now it&#x2019;s Sana&#x2019;s turn to protest. But fair is fair, Ami decrees. In a clever turnaround, Rubina, though sorely tempted to let Sana suffer the embarrassment she did, persuades their mother to let Sana go alone. Khan is of Pakistani descent, and this tale of clashing cultural customs is based on an incident from her childhood. The story (and its lesson) comes to life in Blackall&#x2019;s spot-on illustrations, which focus on the family, their expressions, and body language. Though the sisters wear western clothes, Ami dresses in more traditional garb, a subtle reminder of how assimilation is transformed from generation to generation. At its heart, though, this is an honest, even moving, commentary on sisterly relationships, and the final rapprochement is as sweet as the lollipop Sana offers Rubina. Preschool-Grade 2. --Ilene Cooper</p><h2>Prairie Tale: A Memoir</h2><p>A fascinating, heartbreaking, and ultimately uplifting tale of self-discovery from the beloved actress who earned a permanent place in the hears of millions for her role in <i>Little House on the Prarie </i>when she was just a child.<br><br>To fans of the hugely successful television series <i>Little House on the Prairie</i>, Melissa Gilbert grew up in a fantasy world with a larger-than-life father, friends and family she could count on, and plenty of animals to play with. Children across the country dreamed of the Ingalls&#x2019; idyllic life&#x2014;and so did Melissa.<br> <br> With candor and humor, the cherished actress traces her complicated journey from buck-toothed Laura "Halfpint" Ingalls to Hollywood starlet, wife, and mother. She partied with the Brat Pack, dated heartthrobs like Rob Lowe and bad boys like Billy Idol, and began a self-destructive pattern of addiction and codependence. She eventually realized that her career on television had earned her popularity, admiration, and love from everyone but herself.<br> <br> Through hard work, tenacity, sobriety, and the blessings of a solid marriage, Melissa has accepted her many different identities and learned to laugh, cry, and forgive in new ways. Women everywhere may have idolized her charming life on <i>Little House on the Prairie</i>, but Melissa&#x2019;s own unexpectedly honest, imperfect, and down-to-earth story is an inspiration.</p><p>Melissa Gilbert starred as Laura Ingalls on the hit television show <i>Little House on the Prairie</i>. She has starred in numerous movies and recently served as president of the Screen Actors Guild for two terms. Like Daisy, Melissa was very close to her father as a child. In her memoir, <i>Prairie Tale</i>, she recalls, &#x201c;My earliest memory is of myself, at two and a half or so, watching my father doing his standup act. I was doing his act along with him. I adored my father.&#x201d; She resides in Michigan with her family and French bulldog, Josephine.<i>one</i><br><p>FAIRY DUST<br><br></p><p>My mother was nearly a month past her husband's funeral when she turned her attention back to my desire to write a memoir. It wasn't just a desire; there was an actual book deal, and she was against it. If the book were on any topic other than myself, she would've already been circulating word that "Melissa is writing the best book ever." But this was different. It was about me. Which meant it was also about her. And she was against telling <i>that</i> story if she wasn't the one doing the telling.</p><p>She had tried numerous times to talk me out of it, but her efforts were interrupted by the death of my stepfather, Hollywood publicist Warren Cowan. Now she was back on point.</p><p>She showed up at my house one afternoon carrying a large box packed with news clippings, ads, letters, and diaries of mine. She set it down on the kitchen table with a thud and announced with a smile as deadly as a pearl-handled Derringer that the contents would be helpful.</p><p>"For your <i>book,</i>" she said, pronouncing the word "book" as if it were a petrie dish containing the Ebola virus that I was going to let out in the world.</p><p>I marveled at her gamesmanship -- and at her. She looked a decade younger than her age, which, if revealed, would be taken as a bigger crime than revealing Valerie Plame was a CIA agent. Her hair was blond and coiffed. It's sufficient and necessary to say she was strikingly attractive. She looked great whether going to her weekly appointment at the hair salon or to movie night at the Playboy mansion, which she and my stepfather had attended for years.</p><p>I also cringed at the layers at play here in my kitchen. I thought, thank goodness I have four sons. The mother-daughter relationship is one of mankind's great mysteries, and for womankind it can be hellaciously complicated. My mother and I are quintessential examples of the rewards and frustrations and the joys and infuriations this relationship can yield. By and large, we are close. At times, though, she could render me speechless with her craftiness. Now was one of those times.</p><p>While I sifted through the box packed with sacred bits from my life, my mother offered sly commentary and full-on reinterpretations of the contents. Ah, the contempt and fear and anger she hid behind her helpful smile.</p><p>To me, at forty-four years old, my book was a search for truth and identity. To her, it was -- if only you could have seen the look on her face, you'd fully understand -- the ultimate betrayal.</p><p>I moved on. I made tea. We talked about some of the condolences about Warren that continued to stream in. We mentioned which friends checked on her, the dinner invitations that kept her busy as ever, and of course the latest comings and goings of my husband, Bruce, and my sons. Finally, after we had caught each other up on everything, she returned to the book.</p><p>"You can write the book if you want," she said with a nonchalant shrug.</p><p>"Thank you," I replied. "I'm looking forward to it."</p><p>"I can understand why you want to write it," my mother said. "You write it and get it all out of you."</p><p>"Thank you."</p><p>"You have my blessing."</p><p>"Thank you again."</p><p>"But," she said, "the classy thing would be to burn it after you're finished."<br></p><p>My life was a mystery even as I lived it. </p><p>Several months earlier, I had called my mother and asked if I'd ever had a conversion ceremony to make me officially Jewish. Although I was raised Jewish, my upbringing didn't include any formal religious education or training. We celebrated Passover and other major Jewish holidays. But we also celebrated Christmas and Easter. It's why I always emphasized the "ish" in "Jewish."</p><p>As I got older, though, I grew more observant and intrigued by a more personal relationship with God. One day, as I discussed this with a friend who had converted to Judaism as an adult, she asked if I recalled my conversion ceremony.</p><p>"Huh?" I said.</p><p>My friend explained that adults wanting to switch to Judaism from another religion had to go through a conversion process. It included reading and discussion among friends; a deeper course of investigation with a rabbi; then study, immersion, and approval by a board, culminating with a public ceremony and celebration.</p><p>Even though I was just a day old when my parents adopted me, my friend explained my parents would still have needed a rabbi to perform a ceremony and a blessing to make me officially Jewish. That's when I asked my mother if she recalled doing the ceremony.</p><p>"Why do you need to know now?" she asked.</p><p>"Because if I never had a conversion ceremony, then I'm not really Jewish," I replied. "And if I'm not Jewish -- "</p><p>"But you're Jewish," she interrupted.</p><p>"Who says?" I asked.</p><p>"I do."</p><p>"Mom, believe it or not, you are not the final authority on this issue."</p><p>"I'm your mother," she said. "And I'm Jewish."</p><p>"But my birth parents -- "</p><p>"We adopted you at birth."</p><p>"Was there a conversion ceremony?" I asked.</p><p>"I don't remember," she said.</p><p>"You don't remember?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"No?"</p><p>When it came to my childhood, my mother's memory was more reliable than the Apple-S command on my laptop, so I knew she had the information filed away somewhere. I switched tactics. I asked if she remembered what I did for my second birthday. She did, and described the party she threw me. I then asked if she remembered my first birthday party. She recounted that, too, including the flavor of the cake and the bakery where she bought it.</p><p>"Mom," I said with a dramatic pause worthy of the best courtroom lawyer, "you can remember my first and second birthday parties as if they happened an hour ago. But you can't remember whether you hired a rabbi and had a conversion ceremony for me. How is that?"</p><p>"Melissa!"</p><p>"Mom!"</p><p>"Maybe I didn't have one," she said. "I don't really know. What's the big deal?"</p><p>"It means I'm not Jewish," I said. "It means I'm not who I thought I was for all these years. It changes everything."<br></p><p>Okay, I exaggerated. It wouldn't change everything. When I hung up the phone, I was still going to be me: dressed in sweats, juggling car-pool duties, going to meetings, planning dinner, trying to wedge more into my day than twenty-four hours permitted. In one sense, my life would be fundamentally unchanged.</p><p>However, in another sense, my inner compass had already started to spin wildly out of control. Was there a conversion ceremony? That was a simple question. Was I who I thought I was? Not such a simple question.</p><p>Welcome to my not-so-simple life. My mother, whom I love early, has continually revised my life story within the context of a complicated family history that includes more than the usual share of divorce, stepchildren, dysfunction, and obfuscation, and I've spent most of my adult life attempting to deconstruct that history and separate fact from fiction, especially as the facts pertain to...me!</p><p>For example, my mother was at the helm of everything, including my career, my food intake, and how I dressed -- my whole life. I never questioned her or rebelled. Speaking out against the family was the ultimate form of disloyalty, and disloyalty was not tolerated. It was like the mafia. Although I never feared getting whacked, I was always just a little afraid of being sent back to wherever it was I came from.</p><p>So in an interview back when I was ten years old, I'd likely have said that everything was wonderful, everyone in my life was fantastic, was happy, and life was perfect. But most of that was untrue. Just as it wasn't true when I told a reporter in an interview three months after my mom's second husband suffered a brain hemorrhage that I had my crying moments, but I was pretty tough about that sort of thing.</p><p>The truth is that I never cried over my mom's second husband. I was never close to him. I never liked him. I didn't have any relationship with him. I was dragged to the hospital when he was sick to add cachet so the nurses would take better care of him. I know it was difficult for my mother, but I don't remember being upset about anything at the time.</p><p>Could I say that to the press? Absolutely not.</p><p>A large part of my life has been an illusion -- not an illusion crafted through carefully controlled media; it's more like light going through a prism, in that there's one story bent in numerous directions. There's my mother's version, there's the one in the press, there's the one I lived, and there's the one I'm still trying to figure out.</p><p>However, there are some facts. For instance, I am a twicemarried, now-sober former child actor and mother of four. I acquired those hyphenates by living the way I wanted to or needed to, hopefully with some grace and dignity. I made my share of mistakes, which I think of as the stones I stepped on to get to where I am today, and through luck, hard work, serious reflection, and a desire to face the truth about myself, I ended up at a place where I now enjoy the peace that comes from allowing myself to not be perfect.</p><p>Such was not always the case. My mother, beautiful, delicate, and deluded, saw me as the pillar of perfection -- and told me that I was the world's best actor, the best wife, the best...at everything. I knew I wasn't, but I lived my life as though I had to be, lest I disappoint her.</p><p>Today, I just want to be <i>my</i> best, and I don't fear disappointing anyone other than myself and my family. I'm in love with a good man, and my children are brave, funny, and compassionate people. I love the lines around my eyes, but I hate the way my cheeks are falling; I'm carrying around an extra ten pounds and enjoying it (most of the time). I suppose I am truly fat and happy.</p><p>I play drums, surf, and meditate. I'm in a peaceful state of mind most of the time. Though I am lucky enough to earn a living at a job I love, I'm also thinking about going back to school to get my RN or LVN in end-of-life pediatric care. I'm much better going forward than backward or sideways. I have no real plan, just general dreams.</p><p>It wasn't always like this. I wasn't always at peace. I wasn't always content to let life happen.<br></p><p>For my first couple of decades, there was fairy d...</p></p><h2>When I Miss You (The Way I Feel Books)</h2><p>Young children often experience anxiety when they are separated from their mothers or fathers. In this story a young guinea pig expresses her distress when her mother and father go away. But she eventually finds ways to deal with it.</p><p>Cornelia Maude Spelman is an Albert Whitman author.PreS-K. In this picture book from the well-received the Way I Feel series, Spelman offers support for children with separation anxiety and, in a note to parents and teachers, practical advice for helping kids cope. A little guinea pig narrates, telling her parents how she feels and how she comforts herself when they leave her at day care or with a babysitter. She even mentions how unsettling a parent's business trip can be. While acknowledging anger and sadness ("Missing you is a heavy, achy feeling"), the text and illustrations show the little guinea pig moving beyond her initial despondency into play, laughter, and good times, including the happiness of being reunited. Few picture books deal with this common childhood trial in such a helpful way, acknowledging the emotions and providing reassurance. The lively illustrations feature lively line drawings washed with warm, glowing colors are drawn with a keen eye for the child's world. A good resource for parents and a natural choice for children who will take comfort in finding their emotions mirrored in a picture books. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

She fixes herself a tray, runs a tub of lovely warm water, fills it with bubble bath, and hopes for those precious moments alone before facing the day's activities. The ``activities'' follow her to the bathroom, where, one by one, they present her with their special talents of playing the recorder, reading aloud, and dumping favorite toys from the toy box into the tub with her. When all three children climb in, Mrs. Large decides, with a groan and resignation, that she will try for five minutes' peace in the kitchen. Cheerfully bright watercolor illustrations depict this endearing elephant family with distinctive humor and expression, totally complementing the text on companion pages. However, while the text is simplistic enough for primary readers, the humorous depiction of a beleaguered mother is adult-oriented. Some children may wonder why Mrs. Large wants to get away from her children. Nevertheless, a hearty chuckle can be experienced during a shared reading time between a mother and her childrenperhaps eliciting a bit of understanding.

The Luciferian one world government of Biblical prophecy is unfolding behind the scenes as you read this, and was given the catchy&nbsp;name of the New World Order.&nbsp;The technology currently exists to fulfill all aspects of the Biblical prophecies regarding the End Times, including the resurrection of the original Antichrist, who was the architect of the New World Order over 4,000 years ago. This tyrant will soon be brought back to life using modern day DNA technology to rule the world once again, fulfilling the prophecy of Revelation 17:8&nbsp;"The beast, which you saw, once was, now is not, and will come up out of the Abyss and go to his destruction. The inhabitants of the Earth whose names have not been written in the Book of Life from the creation of the world will be astonished when they see the beast, because he once was, now is not, and yet will come."&nbsp;</p><p>I'm going to show you who&nbsp;the Antichrist is, how and why the plan for the New World Order began, who ran it through history, who runs it today, and what is to happen in the very near future. I explain very clearly all of the most important components of this evil agenda and how they interlock to form a pyramidal, compartmentalized conspiracy run by the Luciferian elites, to the ultimate benefit of only a few thousand of the people involved with bringing the one world government to fruition. &nbsp;</p><p>If you've never heard of the New World Order, what is happening behind the scenes is quite unbelievable. My first book is exactly the 'red pill' that you've heard about....the book that will wake you up to what's really going on in the world. Yes, it's quite disturbing,&nbsp;but there's a happy ending full of hope and promise if you understand what is REALLY going on, that which is plainly laid out in my books.&nbsp;</p><p>Please read the book reviews for this book&nbsp;and you will see that this is a highly important book for you to not only read, but to make others aware of its existence. Book 2 of the series is out now also.&nbsp; Thanks to all for your support! -J. Michael Thomas Hays</p></p><p><p>"Makes the DaVinci Code look like a kindergarten story":&nbsp;In 'Rise of the New World Order: The Culling of Man", all of those pieces of conspiracy theory we have heard over the years are masterfully put together in an incredible panoramic view of realisation. This book offers a matrix like awakening to what is going on in our world, and what makes it more incredible is the factual and historical quotes and accounts of the real people that seek nothing more than to turn humanity into slaves. Unfortunately the overwhelming facts seem so daunting and can leave one thinking there is no hope for us poor slaves. However, faith in God and that all is going according to Biblical prophecy gives us hope that in the end, true good will triumph over evil. A must read for all truth seekers both Christian and non-Christian alike. -Richard/Amazon Reviewer</p></p><h2>Celtic Cable Crochet: 18 Crochet Patterns for Modern Cabled Garments &amp; Accessories</h2><p>Warm up your wardrobe with beautiful cabled pieces!<br><br> The possibilities of crochet cables are endless!

Privacy exists only until the next hack. Credit card fraud is a fact of life. Many of the &#x201c;legacy systems&#x201d; once designed to make our lives easier and our economy more efficient are no longer up to the task.

They reveal the disruption it promises for industries including finance, tech, legal, and shipping.</p><p> Casey and Vigna expose the challenge of replacing trusted (and not-so-trusted) institutions on which we&#x2019;ve relied for centuries with a radical model that bypasses them. <i>The Truth Machine</i> reveals the empowerment possible when self-interested middlemen give way to the transparency of the blockchain, while highlighting the job losses, assertion of special interests, and threat to social cohesion that will accompany this shift.

People I loved and people I hated.</p><p>But there was only one person I loved to hate.</p><p>&#x201c;Why are you doing this?&#x201d; I heard a whiny female voice ask as I rounded the hall to sophomore P.E.</p><p>I immediately halted, locking eyes on a red-faced Tatum Brandt as she faced off with my douchebag stepbrother, Madoc Caruthers, and his friend Jared Trent. They stood in the hallway next to the lockers with flat expressions, looking bored, while she clutched her backpack straps for security.</p><p>&#x201c;You barked at me yesterday,&#x201d; she continued, pinching her eyebrows together at Jared as Madoc smirked from behind him. &#x201c;And then all of your friends followed along. It&#x2019;s been forever, Jared. When are you going to stop? Why are you doing this?&#x201d;</p><p>I sucked in a long breath and completed my usual awesome combination of eye-roll-head-shake.</p><p>I really hated turning corners. I hated closed doors. I hated not seeing the path ahead.</p><p>Corner #1: Your dad and I are getting divorced.</p><p>Corner #2: We&#x2019;re moving. Again.</p><p>Corner #3: I&#x2019;m getting married. Again.</p><p>Corner #952: I don&#x2019;t really like you or my husband or his son, so I&#x2019;m going to take fifteen vacations a year by myself!</p><p>Okay, my mom never really said that, but I&#x2019;m damn good at interpreting shit. And corners sucked.</p><p>I hung back and stuck my hands into the pockets of my skinny jeans, waiting to see what this girl would do. Would she finally grow some balls, or at least take the little ones these idiots had? I kept hoping she would step up to the challenge, and she always disappointed me.</p><p>Tatum Brandt was a wimp.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t know much about her. Only that everyone called her Tate, except Madoc and Jared; she was a rocker on the outside, but played it safe on the inside; and she was pretty. Like cheerleader pretty.</p><p>Long blond hair? Totally.</p><p>Big blue eyes? Absolutely.</p><p>Long legs, full lips, and big boobs? Even at sixteen.</p><p>She was the perfect package, and if I were my stepbrother, I wouldn&#x2019;t have any problem sticking my tongue into her mouth. Hell, I might do it anyway.</p><p>I chewed the corner of my lip, thinking about it. Yeah, I could be a lesbian. Maybe. If I wanted.</p><p>No, never mind.</p><p>The point is . . . why Madoc and Jared tormented her rather than tried to date her was a mystery to me.</p><p>But for some reason I was interested. From the start of freshman year, they had both bullied her. They spread rumors, harassed her, and did everything they could to make her unhappy. They pushed, and she retreated time and again. It was starting to piss me off so much that I was about to go knock their heads together to defend her.</p><p>Except I barely knew her. And Tatum didn&#x2019;t know me at all. I stayed so far off the radar that sonar couldn&#x2019;t pick me up.</p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; Jared answered her question with a question and jutted into her space with a cocky swagger. &#x201c;Because you stink, Tatum.&#x201d; He scrunched up his nose in mock disgust. &#x201c;You smell . . . like a dog.&#x201d;</p><p>Tate straightened immediately, and the tears in her eyes finally spilled over.</p><p>Kick him in the balls, bitch!</p><p>Exhaling a furious breath, I pushed my glasses back up the bridge of my nose. It&#x2019;s what I did before I braced myself.</p><p>She shook her head. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t even remember what today is, do you?&#x201d; She folded her trembling lips between her teeth and looked down at the ground.</p><p>And without even seeing her eyes, I knew what was there. Despair. Loss. Loneliness.</p><p>Without looking at him again, she turned around and walked off.</p><p>It would&#x2019;ve been easy to hit him. To toss an insult back at him. And while I despised her weakness, I understood one thing that I hadn&#x2019;t before. Jared was an ass, but he was an ass who could hurt her.</p><p>She was in love with him.</p><p>Crossing my arms over my chest, I walked over to the lockers where Jared and Madoc stood staring after Tate.</p><p>Madoc spoke up behind him. &#x201c;What did that mean? What&#x2019;s today?&#x201d;</p><p>Jared shrugged off the question. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what she was talking about.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s April fourteenth,&#x201d; I piped up over Madoc&#x2019;s shoulder, causing him to spin around. &#x201c;That mean anything to you, Shit-for-Brains?&#x201d; I directed at Jared.</p><p>Madoc raised a dark blond eyebrow at me, a hint of a smile in his eyes. Jared twisted his head only enough so that I could see the side of his face.</p><p>&#x201c;April fourteenth?&#x201d; he whispered and then blinked long and hard. &#x201c;Shit,&#x201d; he murmured.</p><p>And Madoc reared back a hair as Jared slammed the palm of his hand into the nearest locker door.</p><p>&#x201c;What the hell?&#x201d; Madoc scowled.</p><p>Jared ran his hands down his face and then shook his head. &#x201c;Nothing. Never mind,&#x201d; he growled. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to Geometry.&#x201d; Stuffing his fists into his pockets, he stalked off down the hall, leaving Madoc and me.</p><p>Between my stepbrother and his friend, I respected his friend more. They were both Grade A assholes, but at least Jared didn&#x2019;t care what people thought of him. He stalked around like a weird cross between a jock and a goth. Popular and foreboding. Dark but extremely coveted.</p><p>Madoc, on the other hand, cared what everyone thought. Our parents. The principal. And most of the student body. He loved being loved, and he hated his association with me.</p><p>As sophomores they were already starting to wield power that was going to be out of control by the time they reached senior year.</p><p>&#x201c;Wow, your friend is a loser,&#x201d; I teased, sliding my hands into the back pockets of my jeans.</p><p>Madoc zeroed in on me with his playful half-smile and relaxed eyes. &#x201c;So are your frien&#x2014;&#x201d; he started, then stopped. &#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s right. You don&#x2019;t have any friends.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t need &#x2019;em,&#x201d; I shot back. &#x201c;I travel faster on my own. I&#x2019;m going places. You know that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, you&#x2019;re going places. Just stop at the dry cleaners on your way, Fallon. I need my shirts picked up.&#x201d; He smoothed an arrogant hand over his navy Abercrombie button-down. With his medium-wash boot-cut jeans, black Paracord bracelet, and styled dark blond hair, Madoc dressed to impress. Girls flocked to him because he looked good in clothes, could talk the ears off an elephant, and loved to play. For all intents and purposes, he was a fun guy.</p><p>And he always made me feel small.</p><p>I talked a lot of shit, but truth be told, it was more for my ears than anyone else&#x2019;s. Madoc was designer. I was Target. He was Godiva. I was Snickers. And as far as he was concerned, he was entitled, and I was the freeloading daughter of the gold-digging whore who had snagged his father.</p><p>Madoc thought I was dirt under his shoe. Screw him.</p><p>I gave his outfit a condescending once-over. &#x201c;Your shirts&#x2014;which are super stylish, let me remind you. The gay community would be proud.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You could get nice things, too. My dad pays your mom enough for her services, after all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nice things? Like the miniskirts you date?&#x201d; I challenged. Time to educate the little shit. &#x201c;Most guys, Madoc, like something different. You know why you want to see me in &#x2018;nice,&#x2019; skimpy things? Because the more I show, the less I&#x2019;m hiding. I scare you.&#x201d;</p><p>He shook his head. &#x201c;Nada, little sister.&#x201d;</p><p>Little . . . I was only two months younger than him. He said shit like that to piss me off.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not your little sister.&#x201d; I took a step forward. &#x201c;And I do have friends. And plenty of guys interested. They like how I look. I don&#x2019;t subscribe to you and our snotty parents&#x2019; stand&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wow, I&#x2019;m bored,&#x201d; he cut me off with a sigh. &#x201c;Your life doesn&#x2019;t interest me, Fallon. Holiday dinners and once in a while around the house. Those are the only times I want to run in to you.&#x201d;</p><p>I tipped my chin up, trying not to give anything away. It didn&#x2019;t hurt. Not his words or his opinion of me. There was no ache in my throat that dropped down into my stomach and twisted the ever-present knots tighter. What he said didn&#x2019;t matter. I liked who I was. No one told me how to dress, how to behave, what clubs to join . . . I made my own decisions. Madoc was a puppet. A drone.</p><p>I&#x2019;m free.</p><p>When I said nothing, he started walking backward away from me. &#x201c;The parents are out for the night. I&#x2019;m having a party. Stay out of the way. Maybe hide out in the servants&#x2019; quarters where you belong.&#x201d;</p><p>I watched him go, knowing I wouldn&#x2019;t listen.</p><p>I would wish that I had.<br><br><b>CHAPTER 1</b></p><p>MADOC</p><p>2 years later</p><p>&#x201c;Seriously?&#x201d; I exclaimed. &#x201c;Could she move any slower?&#x201d; I asked Jared as I sat in the backseat of his girlfriend&#x2019;s G8 with my hands locked on top of my head.</p><p>Tate twisted around in the driver&#x2019;s seat, her eyes sharp like she wanted to drive a knife right through my skull. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m heading around a sharp turn at nearly fifty miles an hour on an unstable dirt road!&#x201d; she yelled. &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t even a real race. It&#x2019;s practice. I told you that already!&#x201d; Every muscle in her face was tight as she chewed me out.</p><p>I dropped my head back and let out a sigh. Jared sat in front of me with his elbow on the door and his head in his hand.</p><p>It was Saturday afternoon, a week before Tate&#x2019;s first real race at our local, makeshift track&#x2014;the Loop&#x2014;and we&#x2019;d been on Route Five for the last three hours. Every time the little twerp downshifted too soon or didn&#x2019;t hit the gas fast enough, Jared kept quiet&#x2014;but not me.</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t want to hurt his girlfriend&#x2019;s feelings, but I didn&#x2019;t care. Why tiptoe around her? I wasn&#x2019;t trying to get in her pants.</p><p>Not anymore, anyway.</p><p>Tate and Jared had spent most of high school hating each other. Battling with words and antics in the longest-running game of foreplay I&#x2019;d ever seen. Now they were all up in each other&#x2019;s shit like Romeo and Juliet. The porno version.</p><p>Jared turned his head but not enough to meet my eyes. &#x201c;Get out,&#x201d; he ordered.</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; I blurted, my eyes widening. &#x201c;But . . . but . . .&#x201d; I stuttered, catching sight of Tate&#x2019;s triumphant smile in the rearview mirror.</p><p>&#x201c;But nothing,&#x201d; Jared barked. &#x201c;Go get your car. She can race you.&#x201d;</p><p>The zing of adrenaline shot through me at the prospect of some real excitement. Tate could definitely race a chick who had no idea what she was doing, but she still had a lot to learn and some balls to grow.</p><p>Enter me. I wanted to smile, but I didn&#x2019;t. Instead, I just rolled my eyes. &#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;ll be boring.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, you&#x2019;re so funny,&#x201d; she mocked, gripping the steering wheel even tighter. &#x201c;You make a great twelve-year-old girl when you whine.&#x201d;</p><p>I opened the back door. &#x201c;Speaking of whining . . . want to make a bet on who&#x2019;ll be crying by the end of the day?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You will,&#x201d; she answered.</p><p>&#x201c;Not.&#x201d;</p><p>She grabbed a package of travel tissues and threw them at me. &#x201c;Here. Just in case.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, I see you keep a ready stock,&#x201d; I retorted. &#x201c;Because you cry so much, right?&#x201d;</p><p>She jerked around. &#x201c;Tais-toi! Je te d�tes&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; I interrupted her. &#x201c;What was that? I&#x2019;m hot, and you love me? Jared, did you know she had feelings&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stop it!&#x201d; he bellowed, shutting the both of us up. &#x201c;Goddamn it, you two.&#x201d; He threw his hands up in the air, looking between us like we were misbehaving children.</p><p>Tate and I were both silent for a moment. Then when she snorted, I couldn&#x2019;t help but let out a laugh, too.</p><p>&#x201c;Madoc?&#x201d; Jared&#x2019;s teeth were practically glued together. I could hear the tension in his voice. &#x201c;Out. Now.&#x201d;</p><p>I grabbed my cell off the seat and did as I was told, only because I knew my best friend had had enough.</p><p>I&#x2019;d been trying to bait Tate all day by making jokes and distracting Jared. She was finally racing a real opponent, and even though Jared and I had been working with her, we knew things went wrong out there on the track. All the time. But Tate insisted that she could handle it.</p><p>And what Tate wants, Tate gets. Jared was whipped worse than cream when it came to that girl.</p><p>I walked back down the track to the driveway leading in to it. My silver GTO sat along the side of the road, and I dug in my jeans for my keys with one hand while I ran the back of my hand across my forehead with the other.</p><p>It was early June, and everything was already so miserable. The heat wasn&#x2019;t bad, but the damn humidity made it worse. My mom had wanted me to come to New Orleans for the summer, and I gave her a big, fat hell-to-the-no.</p><p>Yeah, I love sweating my balls off while her new husband tries to teach me shrimping in the Gulf.</p><p>Nope.</p><p>I loved my mom, but the idea of having the house to myself all summer while my dad stayed at his apartment in Chicago was, no doubt, a much better prospect.</p><p>My hand tingled with a vibration, and I looked down at my phone.</p><p>Speak of the devil.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, what&#x2019;s up?&#x201d; I asked my dad as I came up on the side of my car.</p><p>&#x201c;Madoc. Glad you answered. Are you home?&#x201d; He sounded unusually concerned.</p><p>&#x201c;No. I was about to head there soon, though. Why?&#x201d;</p><p>My dad was hardly ever around. He kept an apartment in Chicago. since his big legal cases kept him working long hours. While often absent, he was easy to get along with.</p><p>I liked him. Didn&#x2019;t love him, though.</p><p>My stepmom had been AWOL for a year. Traveling, visiting friends. I hated her.</p><p>And I had a stepsister . . . somewhere.</p><p>The only person I loved at home was Addie, our housekeeper. She made sure I ate my vegetables, and she signed my permission slips for school. She was my family.</p><p>&#x201c;Addie called this morning,&#x201d; he explained. &#x201c;Fallon showed up today.&#x201d; My breath lodged in my throat, and I nearly dropped my phone.</p><p>Fallon?</p><p>Putting my palm down on the hood of my car, I put my head down and tried to stop grinding my teeth.</p><p>My stepsister was home. Why? Why now?</p><p>&#x201c;So?&#x201d; I spat out. &#x201c;What does that have to do with me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Addie packed you a bag.&#x201d; He ignored my question. &#x201c;I talked to Jared&#x2019;s mom, and you&#x2019;re going to stay with them for a few weeks until my schedule frees up. I&#x2019;ll come home then and get this sorted out.&#x201d;</p><p>Excuse me? It felt like the phone would crack under my fingers as I clenched it.</p><p>&#x201c;What? Why?&#x201d; I yelled, breathing hard. &#x201c;Why can&#x2019;t I stay at my own house?&#x201d;</p><p>Since when did she get the run of things? So she was home. Big deal! Send her on her way then. Why did I have to be sent away?</p><p>&#x201c;You know why,&#x201d; my dad answered, his deep tone threatening. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t go home, Madoc.&#x201d;</p><p>And he hung up.</p><p>I stayed planted where I stood, studying the reflection of the trees on the hood of my car. I had been told to go to Jared&#x2019;s house, where Addie ...</p></p><h2>Where&#39;s My Mom?</h2><p>When little monkey can?t find his mother, butterfly offers to help in the search. Little monkey says that his mother is big, so butterfly leads him to . . . an elephant. No, that?s not right! Little monkey says his mom is furry, so butterfly leads him to . . . a bat. That?s not right either. From then on, little monkey and butterfly meet many jungle animals, but they don?t find Mom until little monkey comes up with just the right description.<p> With Julia Donaldson?s effortless rhyme and Axel Scheffler?s vibrant illustrations, this circular tale combines funny miscommunication with a little bit of science for a charming feel-good adventure.<br><br></p></p><p><b>Julia Donaldson</b> lives in Glasgow, Scotland.PreSchool-Grade 1&#x2014;When a little monkey loses his mother, a blundering butterfly swoops in to save the day. Monkey describes his mom as "bigger than me," so the butterfly takes him to an elephant. Then monkey describes his mother with a tail that curls around trees, and the butterfly takes him to a snake. With each new descriptor, the butterfly tries another outlandishly wrong animal until the exasperated monkey points out that none of the suggested mothers even looks like him. However, the butterfly has a very good reason for making such a mistake&#x2014;her babies don't look like her. The bouncy rhyming couplets will charm children, and the butterfly's part can be sung to the tune of "Hush Little Baby." Bold cartoon illustrations on full spreads in bright jungle colors feature a host of expressive insects and creatures. Following a tradition of successful mother-identification stories such as P. D. Eastman's <i>Are You My Mother?</i> (Random, 1960) and Deborah Guarino's <i>Is Your Mama a Llama?</i> (Scholastic, 1989), this story will be entertaining for both groups and one-on-one sharing.&#x2014;<i>Julie Roach, Cambridge Public Library, MA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

After so many months of preparation, the work was finally complete: The motor and blades were bolted and secured, the chain was taut and heavy with grease, and the tower stood steady on its legs. The muscles in my back and arms had grown as hard as green fruit from all the pulling and lifting. And although I&#x2019;d barely slept the night before, I&#x2019;d never felt so awake. My invention was complete. It appeared exactly as I&#x2019;d seen it in my dreams.</p><p>News of my work had spread far and wide, and now people began to arrive. The traders in the market had watched it rise from a distance and they&#x2019;d closed up their shops, while the truck drivers left their vehicles on the road. They&#x2019;d crossed the valley toward my home, and now they gathered under the machine, looking up in wonder. I recognized their faces. These same men had teased me from the beginning, and still they whispered, even laughed.</p><p><i>Let them, </i>I thought. It was time.</p><p>I pulled myself onto the tower&#x2019;s first rung and began to climb. The soft wood groaned under my weight as I reached the top, where I stood level with my creation. Its steel bones were welded and bent, and its plastic arms were blackened from fire.</p><p>I admired its other pieces: the bottle-cap washers, rusted tractor parts, and the old bicycle frame. Each one told its own story of discovery. Each piece had been lost and then found in a time of fear and hunger and pain. Together now, we were all being reborn.</p><p>In one hand I clutched a small reed that held a tiny lightbulb. I now connected it to a pair of wires that dangled from the machine, then prepared for the final step. Down below, the crowd cackled like hens.</p><p>&#x201c;Quiet, everyone,&#x201d; someone said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see how crazy this boy really is.&#x201d;</p><p>Just then a strong gust of wind whistled through the rungs and pushed me into the tower. Reaching over, I unlocked the machine&#x2019;s spinning wheel and watched it begin to turn. Slowly at first, then faster and faster, until the whole tower rocked back and forth. My knees turned to jelly, but I held on.</p><p>I pleaded in silence:<i> Don&#x2019;t let me down.</i></p><p>Then I gripped the reed and wires and waited for the miracle of electricity. Finally, it came, a tiny flicker in my palm, and then a magnificent glow. The crowd gasped, and the children pushed for a better look.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s true!&#x201d; someone said.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said another. &#x201c;The boy has done it. He has made electric wind!&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>My name is William Kamkwamba, and to understand the story I&#x2019;m about to tell, you must first understand the country that raised me. Malawi is a tiny nation in southeastern Africa. On a map, it appears like a flatworm burrowing its way through Zambia, Mozambique, and Tanzania, looking for a little room. Malawi is often called &#x201c;The Warm Heart of Africa,&#x201d; which says nothing about its location, but everything about the people who call it home. The Kamkwambas hail from the center of the country, from a tiny village called Masitala, located on the outskirts of the town of Wimbe.</p><p>You might be wondering what an African village looks like. Well, ours consists of about ten houses, each one made of mud bricks and painted white. For most of my life, our roofs were made from long grasses that we picked near the swamps, or <i>dambos</i> in our Chichewa language. The grasses kept us cool in the hot months, but during the cold nights of winter, the frost crept into our bones and we slept under an extra pile of blankets.</p><p>Every house in Masitala belongs to my large extended family of aunts and uncles and cousins. In our house, there was me, my mother and father, and my six sisters, along with some goats and guinea fowl, and a few chickens.</p><p>When people hear I&#x2019;m the only boy among six girls, they often say, &#x201c;<i>Eh,</i> <i>bambo</i>&#x201d;&#x2014;which is like saying &#x201c;Hey, man&#x201d;&#x2014;&#x201c;so sorry for you!&#x201d; And it&#x2019;s true. The downside to having only sisters is that I often got bullied in school since I had no older brothers to protect me. And my sisters were always messing with my things&#x2014;especially my tools and inventions&#x2014;giving me no privacy.</p><p>Whenever I asked my parents, &#x201c;Why do we have so many girls in the first place?&#x201d; I always got the same answer: &#x201c;Because the baby store was all out of boys.&#x201d; But as you&#x2019;ll see in this story, my sisters are actually pretty great. And when you live on a farm, you need all of the help you can get.</p><p>My family grew maize, which is another word for white corn. In our language, we lovingly referred to it as <i>chimanga</i>. And growing <i>chimanga</i> required all hands. Every planting season, my sisters and I would wake up before dawn to hoe the weeds, dig our careful rows, then push the seeds gently into the soft soil. When it came time to harvest, we were busy again.</p><p>Most families in Malawi are farmers. We live our entire lives out in the countryside, far away from cities, where we can tend our fields and raise our animals. Where we live, there are no computers or video games, very few televisions, and for most of my life, we didn&#x2019;t have electricity&#x2014;just oil lamps that spewed smoke and coated our lungs with soot.</p><p>Farmers here have always been poor, and not many can afford an education. Seeing a doctor is also difficult, since most of us don&#x2019;t own cars. From the time we&#x2019;re born, we&#x2019;re given a life with very few options. Because of this poverty and lack of knowledge, Malawians found help wherever we could.</p><p>Many of us turned to magic&#x2014;which is how my story begins.</p><p>You see, before I discovered the miracles of science, I believed that magic ruled the world. Not magician magic, like pulling rabbits out of hats or sawing ladies in half, the sort of thing you see on television. It was an invisible kind of magic, one that surrounded us like the air we breathe.</p><p>In Malawi, magic came in many forms&#x2014;the most common being the witch doctor whom we called <i>sing&#x2019;anga</i>. The wizards were mysterious people. Some appeared in public, usually in the market on Sundays, sitting on blankets spread with bones, spices, and powders that claimed to cure everything from dandruff to cancer. Poor people walked many miles to visit these men, since they didn&#x2019;t have money for real doctors. This led to problems, especially if a person was truly sick.</p><p>Take diarrhea, for example. Diarrhea is a common ailment in the countryside that comes from drinking dirty water, and if left untreated, it can lead to dehydration. Every year, too many children die from something that&#x2019;s easily cured by a regimen of fluids and simple antibiotics. But without money or faith in modern medicine, the villager takes his chances with the <i>sing&#x2019;anga</i>&#x2019;s crude diagnosis:</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, I know what&#x2019;s wrong,&#x201d; the wizard says. &#x201c;You have a snail.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A snail?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m almost positive. We must remove it at once!&#x201d;</p><p>The wizard goes into his bag of roots, powders, and bones, and pulls out a lightbulb.</p><p>&#x201c;Lift up your shirt,&#x201d; he says.</p><p>Without plugging the bulb into anything, he moves it slowly across the person&#x2019;s stomach, as if to illuminate something only he can detect.</p><p>&#x201c;There it is! Can you see the snail moving?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh yes, I think I can see it. Yes, there it is!&#x201d;</p><p>The wizard returns to his bag for some magic potion, which he splashes across the belly.</p><p>&#x201c;All better?&#x201d; he asks.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, I think the snail is gone. I don&#x2019;t feel it moving.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good. That will be three thousand kwacha.&#x201d;</p><p>For a little extra money, the <i>sing&#x2019;anga</i> can cast curses on your enemies&#x2014;to deliver floods to their fields, hyenas to their chicken house, or terror and tragedy into their homes. This is what happened to me when I was six years old&#x2014;or at least I thought it did.</p><p>I was playing in front of my house when a group of boys walked past carrying a giant sack. They worked for a nearby farmer tending his cows. That morning, as they were moving the herd from one pasture to another, they discovered the sack lying on the road. Looking inside, they saw that it was filled with bubble gum. Can you imagine such a treasure? I can&#x2019;t begin to tell you how much I loved bubble gum!</p><p>Now, as they walked past, one of them spotted me playing in a puddle.</p><p>&#x201c;Should we give some to this boy?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t move or say a word. A bit of mud dripped from my hair.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Eh</i>, why not,&#x201d; his friend said. &#x201c;He looks kind of pathetic.&#x201d;</p><p>The boy reached into his bag and produced a rainbow of gumballs&#x2014;one of every color&#x2014;and dropped them into my hands. By the time the boys disappeared, I&#x2019;d shoved every one into my mouth. The sweet juices dribbled down my chin and stained my shirt.</p><p>Little did I know, but the bubble gum belonged to a local trader, who stopped by our house the next day. He told my father how the bag had dropped from his bicycle as he was leaving the market. By the time he circled back to look for it, the bag was gone. The people in the next village told him about the herd of boys. Now he wanted revenge.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve gone to see the <i>sing&#x2019;anga</i>,&#x201d; he told my father. &#x201c;And whoever ate that bubble gum will be sorry.&#x201d;</p><p>Suddenly I was terrified. I&#x2019;d heard what the <i>sing&#x2019;anga</i> could do to a person. In addition to delivering death and disease, the wizards controlled armies of witches who could kidnap me during the night and shrink me into a worm! I&#x2019;d even heard about them turning children into stones, leaving them to suffer an eternity in silence.</p><p>Already, I could feel the <i>sing&#x2019;anga</i> watching me, plotting his evil. With my heart racing, I ran into the forest behind my house to try to escape, but it was no use. I felt the strange warmth of his magic eye shining through the trees. He had me. At any moment, I would emerge from the forest as a beetle, or a trembling mouse to be eaten by the hawks. Knowing my time was short, I hurried home to where my father was plucking a pile of maize and tumbled into his lap.</p><p>&#x201c;It was me!&#x201d; I shouted, tears running down my cheeks. &#x201c;I ate the stolen gum. I don&#x2019;t want to die, Papa. Please don&#x2019;t let them take me.&#x201d;</p><p>My father looked at me for a second and shook his head. &#x201c;It was you, <i>eh</i>?&#x201d; he said, then kind of smiled.</p><p><i>Didn&#x2019;t he realize I was in trouble?</i></p><p>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; he said, and his knees popped as he rose from his chair. My father was a big man. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, William. I&#x2019;ll find the trader and explain. I&#x2019;m sure we can work something out.&#x201d;</p><p>That afternoon, my father walked five miles to the trader&#x2019;s house and told him what had happened. And even though I&#x2019;d only eaten a few of the gumballs, he paid the man for the entire bag, which was nearly all the money we possessed. That evening after supper, my life having been saved, I asked my father if he truly believed I was in trouble. He became very serious.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh yes, we were just in time,&#x201d; he said, then started laughing so hard his chair began to squeak. &#x201c;<i>William, who knows what was in store for you?</i>&#x201d;</p><p>My fear of wizards and magic only grew worse whenever Grandpa told stories. If you saw my grandpa, you might think he was a kind of wizard himself. He was so old that he couldn&#x2019;t remember the year he&#x2019;d been born. So cracked and wrinkled that his hands and feet looked as if they were chiseled from stone. And his clothes! Grandpa insisted on wearing the same tattered coat and trousers every day. Whenever he emerged from the forest, puffing on his hand-rolled cigar, you&#x2019;d think one of the trees had grown legs and started walking.</p><p>It was Grandpa who told me the greatest story about magic I&#x2019;d ever heard. Long ago, before the giant maize and tobacco farms came along and cleared away our great forests, when a person could lose track of the sun inside the trees, the land was rich with antelope, zebra, and wildebeest&#x2014;also lions, hippos, and leopards. Grandpa was a famous hunter, so good with his bow and arrow that it became his duty to protect his village and provide its meat.</p><p>One day while Grandpa was out hunting, he came across a man who&#x2019;d been killed by a poisonous pit viper. He alerted the nearest village, and soon after, they returned with their witch doctor.</p><p>The <i>sing&#x2019;anga</i> took one look at the dead man, then reached into his bag and tossed some medicines into the trees. Seconds later, the earth began to move as hundreds of vipers slithered out of the shadows and gathered around the corpse, hypnotized by the spell. The wizard then stood on the dead man&#x2019;s chest and drank a cup of potion, which seemed to flow through his feet and into the lifeless body. Then, to Grandpa&#x2019;s amazement, the dead man&#x2019;s fingers began to move and he sat up. Together, he and the wizard inspected the fangs of each snake, looking for the one that had bitten him.</p><p>&#x201c;Believe it,&#x201d; Grandpa told me. &#x201c;I saw this with my own eyes.&#x201d;</p><p>I certainly believed it, along with every other story about witches and things unexplained. Whenever I went down the dark trails alone, my imagination spun wild.</p><p>What scared me most were the <i>Gule Wamkulu,</i> the magical dancers that lived in the murky shadows of the forest. They sometimes appeared in the daylight, performing in tribal ceremonies when we Chewa boys became men. They were not real people, we were told, but spirits of our dead ancestors sent to roam the earth. Their appearance was ghastly: Each had the face and skin of animals and some walked on stilts to appear taller. Once, I saw one scurry backward up a pole like a spider. And when they danced, it was as if one thousand men were inside their bodies, each moving in the opposite direction.</p><p>When the <i>Gule Wamkulu</i> weren&#x2019;t performing, they traveled the forests and <i>dambos</i> looking for young boys to take back to the graveyards. What happened to you there, I never wanted to know. Whenever I saw one, even at a ceremony, I dropped everything and ran. Once, when I was very young, a magic dancer suddenly appeared in our courtyard. His head was wrapped in a flour sack, but underneath was the long nose of an elephant and a gaping hole for a mouth. My mother and father were in the fields, so my sisters and I ran for the bush, where we watched the dancer snatch our favorite chicken.</p><p>Unlike the <i>Gule Wamkulu</i> or <i>sing&#x2019;anga</i> in the market, most witches and wizards never revealed their identity. In the places where they practiced their magic, mystery abounded like strange weather. In the nearby town of Ntchisi, men with bald heads, standing as tall as trees, walked the roads at night. Ghost trucks traveled back and forth, approaching fast with their headlights flashing and engines revving loud. Yet when the lights finally passed, there was no truck attached. In one of the neighboring villages, I heard about a man who&#x2019;d been shrunk so small by a wizard that his wife kept him in a Coke bottle.</p><p>In addition to casting spells for curses, the <i>sing&#x2019;anga</i> often battled one another. At night, they piled aboard their planes and prowled the skies, looking for children to kidnap as soldiers. The witch planes could be anything: a wooden bowl, a broom, a simple hat. And each was capable of traveling great distances&#x2014;Malawi to New York, for example&#x2014;in a single minute. Children were used as guinea pigs and sent to test the powers of rival wizards. Other nights, they&#x2019;d visit camps of other witch children for games of mystical soccer, where the balls wer...</p></p><h2>New St. Joseph Sunday Missal : The Complete Masses for Sundays, Holydays, and the Easter Triduum ; Mass Themes and Biblical Commentaries By John C.

Because it is the one thing that doesn&#x2019;t change in changing times. <br>&nbsp;<br>As the young boy becomes a man, he grows disillusioned with his work and his life.&nbsp; So he returns to ask the old man to help him find The Present. The old man responds, &#x201c;Only you have the power to find The Present for yourself.&#x201d; Heeding the old man&#x2019;s advice, the young man embarks on a worldwide search for this magical gift that remains unchanging in a changing world, and holds the secret to personal happiness and lifelong success.<br>&nbsp;<br>It is only after the young man has searched high and low and all but given up his relentless pursuit that he discovers The Present&#x2014;and all of the promises it offers.<br>&nbsp;<br>Like the young man, you may find that it is the best gift you can ever give to yourself &#x2014; and to those you care about.</p><p>Spencer Johnson, M.D., is one of the most respected and beloved authors in the world.

He thought he heard strain in her voice. <br><br>Bill said yes and rearranged his schedule so they could meet for lunch the next day. When Liz entered the restaurant, he noticed how tired she looked. <br><br>After some small talk and ordering their meals, Liz told him, "I have Harrison's job now."<br><br>"Congratulations," Bill said. "I'm not surprised you've been promoted."<br><br>"Thanks, but the problems are mounting," she admitted. <br><br>"A lot has changed since you were with us. We have fewer people, but more work. There never seems to be enough time to get everything done - at work or at home. <br><br>"And I'm just not enjoying life as much as I'd like to.<br><br>"By the way, Bill," she added, changing the subject, "you look good."<br><br>"I <i>am</i> good," he said. "I'm enjoying my work and life more. It's a nice change for me!"<br><br>"Oh?" she said. "Did your job change?"<br><br>Bill laughed. "No, but if feels like it. It all came together about a year ago." <br><br>"What happened?" Liz wanted to know. <br><br>Bill began, "Remember how hard I used to push myself and others to get good results? And how much time and effort it took us to get things done?" <br><br>Liz laughed. "I remember all too well."<br><br>Bill smiled, as though amused by his old behavior. "Well I've learned a few things. And so have many other people in my department. We're getting better results, faster and with less stress.<br><br>"And to top it off, I'm enjoying life more."<br><br>"What's happened?" Liz asked. <br><br>"If I told you, you probably wouldn't believe it."<br><br>"Try me," she replied. <br><br>He paused and then said, "I heard a story from a good friend of mine. It turned out to be a real gift. In fact, the story is called The Present."<br><br>"What is it about?" Liz inquired.<br><br>"It's a story about a young man who discovers a way to live and work that makes him happier and more successful.<br><br>"After I heard it, I thought a lot about the story and how I could benefit from using it. I started using what I learned, first at work and then later in my personal life. It had a big impact on me, and others began to notice. <br><br>"Like the young man in the story, I'm happier now, and I'm doing better."<br><br>"How?" Liz asked. "In what way?"<br><br>"Well, I now concentrate better on what I am doing. I learn more from what happens, and I'm able to plan better. I can focus now on getting the more important things done, without taking so long to do them."<br><br>"You got all that out of one story?" Liz seemed amazed. <br><br>"Well that's what <i>I</i> got out of the story. Different people get different things from The Present, depending on where they are in their work or life when they hear it. Of course, some people just don't get it at all. <br><br>"The story is a practical parable," Bill continued. "So it's not just what's <i>in</i> the story. It's what you take <i>out</i> of it that gives it value."<br><br>Liz asked, "Can you tell it to me?"<br><br>Bill sipped his glass of water and then said slowly, "Liz I hesitate because you've always seemed to be so skeptical. And this is the type of story you might dismiss too easily."<br><br>At that point, Liz let her guard down. She confessed that she was under a great deal of stress, in her job and personal life, and had come to lunch hoping to get some help. <br><br>Bill remembered when he felt that way. <br><br>Liz said, "I really want to hear the story."<br><br>Bill had always liked and respected Liz. So he said, "I'd be happy to tell it to you, if you agree that what you get and use from the story is up to you. <br><br>"And," he added, "If you find it useful, that you will share it with others."<br><br>Liz agreed and Bill continued. "When I first heard it, I realized at some point in the story that there was a great deal more to it than I had anticipated. <br><br>"I found myself taking notes throughout the story to help me remember the insights I might want to use later."<br><br>Liz wondered what she might fine useful for herself. She took out a small notepad and said, "I'm ready to listen."<br><br>Then Bill began to tell the story of The Present.</p><h2>Even Firefighters Go to the Potty: A Potty Training Lift-the-Flap Story</h2><p><i>Clang! Clang! Clang!</i> The fire truck is pulling out of the station. But wait! Where is the firefighter going? To the potty! Even firefighters go to the potty! <br><br>Toddlers are uneasy about toilet training. And in most cases, even if they know they have to go, sometimes they are too busy to bother. In this hilarious gate-fold story, each person--from a firefighter on the way to answer a fire alarm to a zoo keeper on the way to feed the polar bears--stops what they are doing to go to the potty. With humor and no pedantics, toddlers learn that everybody uses the potty.</p><p>Wendy Wax has written many children&#x2019;s books, including <i>City Witch, Country Switch</i>; <i>Even Firefighters Go to the Potty</i>; <i>Clara the Klutz</i>; <i>Bus to Booville</i>; and <i>Even Princesses Go to the Potty</i>.

Visit him at SGilpin.com.PreS&#x2014;This lift-the-flap book reinforces that everyone, everywhere, regardless of what they may do professionally, must take the time to stop and "go to the potty." Each scenario stretches over one and a half pages with the remaining space devoted to a flap (decorated as a restroom door) to open. In each case, readers are presented with activity in progress. However, a key worker is missing: "The fire alarm is ringing! The fire truck needs to go. But where did the firefighter who drives the truck go?" Open the door, and thus intrude upon the missing adult who has just recently used, or in some cases still is sitting on, the toilet. Readers visit the police station, construction site, doctor's office, baseball field, zoo, and more to discover again and again that important people are in the restroom. The bright, glossy cartoon drawings contain small details (the astronaut has toilet paper stuck to his space boot and the train engineer has train cars on his boxer shorts) that add to the goofiness and help relieve tension for a topic that can be embarrassing. Unfortunately, the brief text becomes overly repetitive, but the demand for books on the topic makes this a slight, albeit silly, addition to most collections.&#x2014;<i>Laura Butler, Mount Laurel Library, NJ</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Okay, the whole world is a Simon Snow fan, but for Cath, being a fan is her life&#x2015;and she's really good at it. She and her twin sister, Wren, ensconced themselves in the Simon Snow series when they were just kids; it's what got them through their mother leaving.</p><p>Reading. Rereading. Hanging out in Simon Snow forums, writing Simon Snow fan fiction, dressing up like the characters for every movie premiere.</p><p>Cath's sister has mostly grown away from fandom, but Cath can't let go. She doesn't want to.<br>Now that they're going to college, Wren has told Cath she doesn't want to be roommates. Cath is on her own, completely outside of her comfort zone. She's got a surly roommate with a charming, always-around boyfriend, a fiction-writing professor who thinks fan fiction is the end of the civilized world, a handsome classmate who only wants to talk about words . . . And she can't stop worrying about her dad, who's loving and fragile and has never really been alone.</p><p>For Cath, the question is: Can she do this? Can she make it without Wren holding her hand? Is she ready to start living her own life? And does she even want to move on if it means leaving Simon Snow behind?</p><p>A <i>New York Times Book Review </i>Notable Children's Book of 2013 <br>A <i>New York Times</i> Best Seller!</p></p><p><p><b>Rainbow Rowell's Playlist</b></p> Rainbow Rowell <p><i>Fangirl</i> is a coming-of-age novel that is smart, funny, and genuine. <i>Fangirl</i> takes place during Cather Avery's first year of college, learning who she is when stripped down to just Cath--not the twins Cath &amp; Wren and not Magicath, her fan fiction pen name.</p> <p>Through all the changes, both difficult and thrilling, one part of her old life still makes as much sense in her dorm room as it did in her childhood bedroom--the Emergency Kanye Party. When the going gets tough in this story, the tough crank up Kanye West, sing out loud and dance until they feel better. Check out Rowell's <i>Fangirl</i> playlist below to see what other music played a part in this story.</p> <p>"I Wonder" &#x2013; Kanye West: So Cath, the main character of Fangirl has a Kanye West thing; he's sort of her Patronus. This song lays out how lost Cath is at the beginning of the book. "You ever wonder what it all really mean? You wonder if you'll ever find your dreams?"</p> <p>"Cath" &#x2013; Death Cab for Cutie: I think this song might be the reason I chose the name "Cath." The lyrics don't fit my Cath, but the feelings do. More loss, more lost.</p> <p>"Heaven's on Fire" &#x2013; The Radio Dept.: I use songs to help me get into the right mood and frame of mind when I'm writing a scene. This song, for me, is Cath's first few weeks of college &#x2013; when she feels all caught up, and completely overwhelmed, by the activity. When she's overdosing on new and other.</p> <p>"Paranoid" &#x2013; Kanye West feat. Mr. Hudson: When things hit bottom for Cath, she throws herself an Emergency Kanye Dance Party. I can see her jumping on her bed to this song. "You worry bout the wrong things, the wrong things."</p> <p>"American Boy" &#x2013; Estelle feat. Kanye West: Required listening for every Emergency Kanye Dance Party. Plus, it's happy and bouncy, so that reminds me of Cath's friend Levi, who joins the party.</p> <p>"Brandy Alexander" &#x2013; Feist: When Cath finally falls in love, she almost resents how easy it is. She resents that she can't help it. This song is so sweet and seductive and irresistible &#x2013; which is exactly how Cath sees the guy she's falling for.</p> <p>"I See You, You See Me" &#x2013; The Magic Numbers: This is another reluctant love song &#x2013; about two people who sort of back into love. When it gets to "This is not what I'm like, this is not what I do" &#x2013; I think of Cath and the way she tries to reject her feelings. Like she's allergic to them.</p> <p>"Love Letters" &#x2013; Jude: There's a part of the book when just about everybody regrets their behavior. "Love Letters" feels like regret to me &#x2013; but also hope. There's so much longing in Jude's voice.</p> <p>"Samson" &#x2013; Regina Spektor: One of the love stories in the book is between Cath and her twin sister, Wren. Cath feels abandoned by Wren. Now that they're at college, Wren would rather party than hang out with her twin. But Cath is still so devoted to Wren, and worried about her. "You are my sweetest downfall. I loved you first."</p> <p>"Landslide" &#x2013; Fleetwood Mac: Every book I write has "Landslide" on its soundtrack, and always at the same point in the story &#x2013; the part where the main character does whatever he or she has to do to grow and change. I play "Landslide" in my head whenever my life is changing in a big way.</p> <p>"Hymn for Her" &#x2013; The Magic Numbers: This is my happy-ending song for Cath. I'm not exactly sure what the lyrics mean, but I love how gentle and cautious it is, especially at the beginning. It's so reassuring for a love song. "It won't hurt to find love in the wrong place. I've been hurt before, but all the scars have rearranged."</p>RAINBOW ROWELL lives in Omaha, Nebraska, with her husband and two sons.

After becoming frustrated with the ineffectiveness and sometimes severe side effects of synthetic remedies, she started researching whether or not natural cures could be made to the same effect, without the use of synthetic means. After dedicating years of her life to research, learning from natural remedies masters, as well as from doctors that use natural cures to help their patients, she decided it was time to share the knowledge she had gathered with the world. One of Mary&#x2019;s life goals is to make the world a better, happier place, and her writings are definitely a testament to that. She has not just kept all of her research and discoveries to herself. She has elected to share them, in a format that makes them available to just about everyone. And instead of just talking about just the unknown or difficult to find herbs as many naturalists do, she has selected remedies that anyone can make, so that every person can make themselves healthier, easily and inexpensively.

The coordinated focus of these materials is unique: biblical content, provocative questions, systematic theology, practical application, and the gospel story of God&#x2019;s grace presented all the way through Scripture.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Philip Graham Ryken,</strong> President, Wheaton College</p><p>&#x201c;These <em>Knowing the Bible</em> volumes introduce a significant and very welcome variation on the general run of inductive Bible studies. Such series often provide questions with little guidance, leaving students to their own devices. They thus tend to overlook the role of teaching in the church. By contrast, Knowing the Bible avoids the problem by providing substantial instruction with the questions. Knowing the Bible then goes even further by showing how any given passage connects with the gospel, the whole Bible, and Christian theology. I heartily endorse this orientation of individual books to the whole Bible and the gospel, and I applaud the demonstration that sound theology was not something invented later by Christians, but is right there in the pages of Scripture.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Graeme Goldsworthy,</strong>&nbsp;Former Lecturer in Old Testament, Biblical Theology, and Hermeneutics, Moore Theological College</p><p>&#x201c;What a gift to earnest, Bible-loving, Bible-searching believers! The organization and structure of the Bible study format presented through the <em>Knowing the Bible</em> series is so well conceived. Students of the Word are led to understand the content of passages through perceptive, guided questions, and they are given rich insights and application all along the way in the brief but illuminating sections that conclude each study. What potential growth in depth and breadth of understanding these studies offer. One can only pray that vast numbers of believers will discover more of God and the beauty of his Word through these rich studies.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Bruce A. Ware,</strong>&nbsp;T.

During the dangerous days of Jim Crow segregation, it was difficult to be an African-American traveler, as hotels that would take you or restaurants that would serve you were few and far between. This was addressed by The Negro Motorist Green Book, an annual listing of lodging, diners, gas stations, and other businesses that could handle the needs of the Black customer. Created in 1936 by Harlem-based postman Victor H. Green, the Green Book served the public until after the passage of the Civil Rights Act in the 1960s ended legal segregation. Original copies of the Green Book are now museum pieces, but in this book you can see all the articles, all the ads, and all the listings from four editions of the Green Book, one for each decade in which the series was published. The Negro Motorist Green Book of 1938 is an early example, covering only the states east of the Mississippi River, but also presenting articles on &#x201c;The Automobile and What It Has Done for the American Negro&#x201d; as well as driving tips. In 1947, the Negro Motorist Green Book had listings for 45 of the 48 states that then existed (there was nothing for Nevada, New Hampshire, or North Dakota), and that also included directories of the Negro colleges and newspapers of the day, as well as a look at the current models from Ford and GM, and some notes on automotive design of the future. By 1954, the title had changed to The Negro Travelers' Green Book, and the volume includes an article on the highlights of San Francisco (which was &#x201c;fast becoming the focal point of the Negroes' future&#x201d;) and tourist guides to New York City and Bermuda. Finally, the Travelers' Green Book for 1963 through 1964 leads off with a state-by-state listings of rights against &#x201c;jimcro&#x201d; (Jim Crow segregation), plus it has &#x201c;Guide Posts for a Pleasant Trip,&#x201d; a couple of cartoon-illustrated sidebars on Black history-makers, a listing of major league ballparks, and other useful items for the traveler. And all of it reproduced at about 50% larger than the original size, for easier reading. Reprints of the Green Book published by About Comics have gotten coverage by Newsweek, the Guardian, and BBC News, and more. They are carried by major museums, and have been used by TV and film. Now you can get four editions in one convenient volume, and see why the New York Times called the Green Book a &#x201c;beacon for Black travelers.&#x201d;</p><p></p><h2>Max and the Tag-Along Moon</h2><p><b>Experience the wonder of the moon following you home with a Coretta Scott King Award-winning illustrator!

The life of a fox is filled with dangers, but Isla has begun to learn mysterious skills meant to help her survive.<br> Then the unthinkable happens. Returning to her den, Isla finds it set ablaze and surrounded by strange foxes, and her family is nowhere in sight. Forced to flee, she escapes into the cold, gray world of the furless.<br> Now Isla must navigate this bewildering and deadly terrain, all while being hunted by a ruthless enemy. In order to survive, she will need to master the ancient arts of her kind -- magical gifts of cunning known only to foxes. She must unravel the secrets of foxcraft.</p><p>Inbali Iserles is an award-winning writer and an irrepressible animal lover. She is one of the team of authors behind the New York Times bestselling Survivors series, writing under the pseudonym of Erin Hunter. Her first book, <i>The Tygrine Cat</i>, won the 2008 Calderdale Children's Book of the Year Award. Together with its sequel, <i>The Tygrine Cat: On the Run</i>, it was listed among <i>The Independent's</i> "50 books every child should read." <br><br>Inbali attended Sussex and Cambridge Universities. For many years she lived in central London, where a fascination with urban foxes inspired her Foxcraft trilogy. She has recently moved to Cambridge with her family, including her principal writing mascot, Michi, who looks like an Arctic fox, acts like a cat, but is in fact a dog.Gr 3&#x2013;6&#x2014;Isla's life is carefree and comfortable, although she lives in the Great Snarl with Ma, Fa, Greatma, and her inseparable and more talented twin, Pirie. Suddenly, all is snatched from her when she lags behind and comes back to her den to find a shulk of mean-looking foxes, led by the one-eyed Karka, burning down her home. She takes off before she can be captured, but finds herself in the dangerous world of the furless (humans) following the deathway (highway) and unable to eat anything more than beetles and worms. The young kit soon finds herself in the company of a dog. When she begins to see his true shape, he wa'akkirs (shape shifts) to reveal his true self: the beautiful red fox Siffrin, sent by the Elders to retrieve Pirie. He teaches Isla about Foxcraft, the cunning magic of the fox, and she is able to connect with Pirie in her dreams as they continue their search. But all is not as it appears with Siffrin, and Isla realizes that he might not be a friend when she catches sight of the half rose mark on him. The mark is that of the foxes of Karka's shulk, those called the Taken, who are controlled by the evil Mage. With so many questions remaining at the end, there is sure to be another installment in this series that will explore more parts and places of the fox world. Reminiscent of the "Warriors" series (HarperCollins), to which the author contributed, and similar to Kathryn Lasky's "Guardians of Ga'Hoole" series (Scholastic), this title takes the actual habits and attributes of real foxes and mixes in magic and a complex social structure. This book will be enjoyed by readers who like well-crafted fantasy of the furry kind.

And besides, there is not enough extra thread for Ixchel to practice with.</p> <p>Disappointed, Ixchel first tries weaving with blades of grass, and then with bits of wool, but no one would want to buy the results. As she walks around her village, Ixchel finds it littered with colorful plastic bags. There is nowhere to put all the bags, so they just keep accumulating.</p> <p>Suddenly, Ixchel has an idea! She collects and washes the plastic bags. Then she cuts each bag into thin strips. Sitting at her loom, Ixchel weaves the plastic strips into a colorful fabric that looks like a beautiful rainbow just like the weavings of Mayan women before her.</p>"</p><p><p>LINDA ELOVITZ MARSHALL grew up near Boston, graduated from Barnard College, and raised four children and a flock of sheep on a farm in the Hudson Valley of New York. She is the author of several books for young readers and was inspired to write this story by dear friends and founders of Mayan Hands, an organization of weavers in Guatemala.

Born in Peru, she now lives with her husband and their daughter, cat, and dog in northernMichigan.</p>K-Gr 3&#x2014;Fans of Omar S. Casta�eda's Abuela's Weave will enjoy this lovely selection about perseverance, community, and the ancient Mayan art of weaving. In order to earn money at the market, the women in young Ixchel's Guatemalan village "weave thread into fabric as beautiful as a rainbow." The girl desperately wants to learn and participate in this traditional art, but her mother gently refuses. Mama tells her that the money she earns from the cloth will be used to purchase books and fund an education for Ixchel. The cloth must be eye-catching in order to earn a good price. Ixchel is disappointed but determined to help and soon comes up with a creative way to clean up her village and weave a unique type of cloth. Vibrant illustrations bring the story to life and provide readers with a glimpse of indigenous Guatemalan culture. The images could also be used during a discussion about facial expressions and how they communicate emotions. The English and Spanish texts are clearly delineated. The author incorporates several words in Kaqchikel, one of the Mayan languages spoken in Guatemala. A glossary and pronunciation guide are provided at the beginning of the volume. A detailed author's note at the narrative's conclusion explains the inspiration for this tale. Pair this with a simple weaving project and some primary source photographs. VERDICT An uplifting offering that would be a wonderful addition to picture book collections and STEAM programs.&#x2014;Katie Darrin, Boulder Valley School District, CO</p><h2>Minecraft: The Crash: An Official Minecraft Novel</h2><p><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER </b>�&nbsp;<b>This official Minecraft novel is an action-packed thriller!

There was one thing that I really wanted to try. Flying. From the top of the hill, I jumped twice, expecting my avatar to soar into the sky. Instead, I tumbled down a few blocks. Must be survival mode and not creative, I thought. I climbed back up and looked around. On the other side of the hill, in the distance, was a eld of brown. A desert biome, I guessed. There didn&#x2019;t seem to be any villagers or buildings, so I turned and went north, following the curve of the river. I ran past mobs of pigs and sheep, clumps of trees, and elds of owers. Much farther away, things turned green. Swampy. I&#x2019;d have time to explore all of that later. What I wanted was to check out the village on the other side of the river. So I turned my gaze, and the entire world turned beneath me, pointing me in the di- rection of the village near my home base. <br><br> Running in the game felt amazing. The world whizzed by me, and the exhilaration of being able to sprint around was intoxicating. I could almost pretend that they were really my legs pumping beneath me, sending me ying through the Technicolor scenery. &#x201c;Optical illusion,&#x201d; I said out loud. I knew I was really lying in bed in a hospital room, and the entire world around me was a projection of light that extended only as far as the goggles did. It wasn&#x2019;t real. None of it.<br><br> It reminded me of a unit we did on optical illusions with my eighth-grade art teacher, Mrs. Franklin. I loved it. There was the Necker cube&#x2014;a cube drawn in two dimensions&#x2014;that you could see two different ways depending on which plane you decided was &#x201c;front&#x201d; or &#x201c;top,&#x201d; and also the Hering illusion, which showed how a at illustration could appear to curve or even move with a series of strategically placed straight lines. But my favorite was the snake illusion, a circle of colors that only seemed to move when you weren&#x2019;t looking directly at it. It seemed like magic, like the colors themselves had a mind that could read me, and know when I wasn&#x2019;t looking, and prank me for its own pleasure. Even when we&#x2019;d moved past the optical illusions unit, I was still making snake illusions, pretending that they were actively trying to interact with me, but only on their own terms. <br><br> &#x201c;Vision is one of the primary ways we process the world around us,&#x201d; Mrs. Franklin had said. &#x201c;But always remember, eyes can be tricked, which in turn can trick your brain.&#x201d; <br><br> I stopped near the edge of the river and batted a nearby ower, but nothing happened, so I went on my way. <br><br>&#x201c;Everything really is an illusion here.&#x201d; <br><br> At the water&#x2019;s edge, cubes of blue indicated a narrow river, and cubes of brown and green on the other side told me there was land. If I wanted to, I could count up the squares and know exactly how many cubes made up my vision, but why spoil the fun? That would be like going to a magic show and calling out all the ways the magician was making the tricks happen. First of all, it&#x2019;s rude, and second of all, it ruins everything. Despite it being an optical illusion, I was happy to be where I was, standing by a river, instead of lying down in my own dull reality. <br>From this side of the river, the village looked enticing. I opened up the crafting table, silently thanking A.J. again for giving me a full inventory at the start, and made planks of wood. Then I constructed what I thought was a pretty solid, sturdy boat. A sheep wandered over as I nished. It looked up. Not at me, just up, as I pushed off across the river. <br><br> &#x201c;This is pretty cool. I gotta hand it to you, kid,&#x201d; I said to A.J. out in the real world. <br><br> The sheep lumbered off, and A.J. didn&#x2019;t say anything. <br><br> I looked at the water as the boat crossed the river. I wished I could dip my hand into the water and feel it, but I knew that wouldn&#x2019;t happen. <br><br> &#x201c;Illusion, illusion, illusion,&#x201d; I said aloud. I laughed for the rst time in . . . I didn&#x2019;t know how long. <br><br> The boat slowed as it got to the other shore, and I hopped out. Ahead was the little village, which looked much bigger now that I was so close up. Immediately a few of the villagers turned to look at me, and in a few moments I was surrounded by villagers mut- tering at me in several slightly different tones.<br><br> So, a couple of things. First, we were all the same size. I&#x2019;m used to being short and having to look up at people, so that was weird. And second, all of them were looking at me with these blank, unfeeling eyes that I thought I&#x2019;d be used to from playing the game, but something about the way their glances seemed to bounce right off me made me feel cold. I muscled my way through the throng of villagers and walked toward the rst building&#x2014; a butcher&#x2019;s shop. There was a bench outside and a pen around the back. This was all usual stuff, but I didn&#x2019;t expect that walking up to the building would feel so impressive and realistic. The door even squeaked a little as I went in. The butcher looked up and muttered in my direction, but when I didn&#x2019;t engage, it went back to working on something behind the counter. I thought about the meat I could get from the butcher, and that alone was effective enough that I thought my stomach actually rumbled. I wondered when the last time was that I&#x2019;d had a solid meal. I didn&#x2019;t remember eating anything since before the accident. I wondered what had happened to my brownies. There was the IV drip, which I guessed was keeping me packed with nutrients, but what I was suddenly craving was a ham sandwich. <br><br> I picked up some pork, and the butcher came over. The trade popped up just over the villager&#x2019;s head, so I made it and walked out. The butcher muttered again at my exit. <br><br> With my VR hunger satis ed, I went back over to the water right outside the village and began to work on phase one of Lonnie&#x2019;s master plan&#x2014;making obsidian for the nether portal. Everyone knows that if water hits a lava source block, it becomes obsidian. Most players would just carry some buckets of water into an underground cave, but Lonnie always had a air for the dramatic. It was his idea to dig down until we hit a lava pool, then divert an entire river into it.<br>&#x201c;Just imagine it!&#x201d; he&#x2019;d said as he showed me his schematics. &#x201c;A waterfall into lava and boom, obsidian for days!&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Man, now I really wish you were here, Lonnie,&#x201d; I whispered. He would make the work go by much faster. If I could have rolled up my sleeves in Minecraft, I would have. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s do this,&#x201d; I said to no one, dusting my palms together. Well, my limbs didn&#x2019;t really touch. My block hands moved near each other in a way that looked more like I was about to play rock, paper, scissors, with only the obvious draw as the outcome. Not having actual hands was a minor drawback, but there were many advantages in my new pixelated existence, too. Using the pickaxe in my inventory, I started digging out a new ow from the main river. <br><br> After a few minutes of working, I felt the weight of someone looking at me. I knew that I was inside a game. I knew that this was all an illusion. But that look felt real somehow. It was like those intense looks you feel when you can tell someone is staring at you from across the room, even if your back is turned. <br><br> &#x201c;This is ridiculous,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just a game.&#x201d; <br><br> Still, I turned to look. A villager in a dark blue shirt with a large X crisscrossing it stared at me from across the river near where the boat was docked. I blinked a few times, wondering if I was just being weird, or maybe I was getting disoriented again. But the villager simply stared back.<br><br>&nbsp;A spark of recognition ignited in my brain. The back of my neck prickled. I knew someone with that exact T-shirt. &#x201c;L-Lonnie?&#x201d; <br><br> I could almost feel my pores constrict. How was this possible? It wasn&#x2019;t Lonnie&#x2019;s avatar, by any means. It lacked his skin mods and cape. But no doubt about it, the villager was somehow Lonnie. <br><br> The strangely dressed villager suddenly disappeared back into the village. <br><br> &#x201c;Hey, wait! Come back!&#x201d; <br><br> I took off after it. My mind was racing. Was there a glitch when Lonnie tried to log on, and he somehow got zapped into a villager? <br><br> I was running past the shops and houses, down a cobblestone street that turned away from the river and toward that villager. Every turn, the Lonnie villager eluded me, and ran down another path. I chased until I couldn&#x2019;t orient myself anymore, and I had to look around for the hills to know which way the river was, and therefore home base. I turned down what seemed to be an abandoned alleyway that was more crudely constructed than the rest of the village, and found myself staring down a villager in the shadow of one of the buildings. I moved forward, and it moved forward too, matching me step for step. I moved to the side. So did it. Now it was in the light and I could see that it was the same villager again. Blue shirt. Big X across the front. I could feel adrenaline start to pump through me. My head hurt for a couple of seconds, but then it stopped.<br><br>&nbsp;<br> Until this villager showed up, I&#x2019;d felt perfectly ne inside the game. But now? I could feel my heart beat in my ears. I gulped down some air and swallowed hard enough to settle the rising gall inside myself. <br><br> &#x201c;What happened to you, Lonnie? What room did they put you in?&#x201d; <br><br> The villager moved toward me in slightly jerky steps, like it was hesitating to see what I would do rst. He made no sound and turned down a different path away from me. His avatar was really Lonnie-like, with dark skin and gray eyes. I tried to search his movements for some sign of the Lonnie I knew on the outside, something that could help me be sure this was really him. Just as I got closer, he looked up, directly at me, and I jumped back. <br><br> &#x201c;Hello, Earth to Elon,&#x201d; I yelled, using Lonnie&#x2019;s real name. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re on mute or something.&#x201d; I waited and strained my ears for any sound other than the music and sounds of general movement inside the game, but there was nothing. I looked around the inter- face. The only other villager I&#x2019;d gotten up close and personal with was the butcher, and when it was close enough, the health bar and the trade bar came up right over it. But not with this one. I wondered if it was some kind of glitch or a new type of character that didn&#x2019;t interact the way others did. Maybe it was a VR feature and that&#x2019;s why I didn&#x2019;t get it. <br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re being super weird,&#x201d; I said. I tried to touch Lonnie&#x2019;s head but he just backed away. His eyes were dull, just like all the other villagers. It was unsettling, but I pushed that feeling down. <br><br> &#x201c;Well, as long as you&#x2019;re here. I need your help by the river.&#x201d;<br><br> I took off in the direction of my ongoing project of diverting the water ow to a new pond. Surprisingly, Lonnie followed, still not speaking. Ahead were the hills where I&#x2019;d built my one-room cabin, which meant the river was a little to the right. I moved down the street, knocking villagers out of the way as I went. Each of them turned to look in my direction, but not really at me. Like how villagers were supposed to do. <br><br> I got to the riverbank and quickly crafted Lonnie a second boat, saying, &#x201c;Come on!&#x201d; before jumping into my own. As we rowed to the other shore, I looked back at the village. It looked the same. Bright, bustling. <br><br> When I got out of the game world, I was going to make the nurses tell me where real-life Lonnie was. But for now I was content to have some help for once. There&#x2019;d be plenty of time to gure out real life. What I wanted to do was explore and build with my best friend. <br><br> Now, it was time to play.</p><h2>Messages from Your Animal Spirit Guides Oracle Cards: A 44-Card Deck and Guidebook!</h2><p>Animal spirit guides are spirit helpers in animal form who can provide guidance for questions you have about any aspect of your life.

THE PARTNER TRACK is her first novel. She is now at work on a second book.ONE <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>The Parsons Valentine dining room&#x2014;affectionately known as the Jury Box&#x2014;resembled nothing so much as a high school cafeteria, writ large. We were all older, sure, with expensive haircuts and finely tailored suits. The food was a lot better, and it was served on fine china, classic white with a platinum border. And then there was the view. Instead of a track or a football field, our windows overlooked the grand expanse of Fifth Avenue and Central Park. No trophy cases or spirit banners, either, just a vast Ellsworth Kelly painting and a few signed Chuck Close prints adorning the otherwise stark white walls. But these were just trophies of a different sort. <br>At Parsons Valentine &amp; Hunt LLP, every step you took was a carefully calibrated decision, right down to where you sat at lunch&#x2014;especially the year you were up for partner. The powers-that-be took meticulous note of who was allied with whom. If you regularly sat at a table to gossip and gab with other associates, it telegraphed <i>lazy</i> and <i>unambitious.</i> If you sat only with partners, it screamed <i>brownnoser.</i> Sitting off by yourself, not surprisingly, was the worst kind of professional suicide&#x2014;you might as well walk around wearing a big SOCIAL LIABILITY sign around your neck. And the worst thing you could be at Parsons Valentine was <i>unpresentable</i>. <br>At lunch in the Jury Box, we were spoiled for choice. I navigated my way around the freshly stocked salad bar, past the sushi chef, deli counter, brick-oven pizza and teppanyaki lines, and stopped at the hot entr�e station. Mason, the firm&#x2019;s executive director of Dining Services&#x2014;he&#x2019;d apprenticed at Le Bernardin&#x2014;was standing behind the sneeze guard, wearing his chef&#x2019;s hat and a crisp white apron. Mason was one of my favorite people at the firm. He&#x2019;d once sent a steak sandwich to my office when I was stuck on a late-night conference call. I&#x2019;d never forgotten it. <br>&#x201c;Hey, Mason, what are you pushing today?&#x201d; I asked. <br>&#x201c;Well, well. Ingrid Yung. My favorite customer.&#x201d; He gestured with a flourish at the row of silver chafing dishes. &#x201c;Today we&#x2019;ve got some beautiful seared ahi tuna steaks with avocado tartare.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Hm. Sounds healthy.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And over here I&#x2019;ve got my famous spicy three-cheese lasagna.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sold.&#x201d; <br>I walked my lasagna and a Perrier over to the cashier line. The guy in front of me, some fourth-year Litigation associate I&#x2019;d never spoken to, was busily scratching a client matter number onto a checkout form with a stubby yellow golf pencil. <br>Parsons Valentine attorneys had the option of paying for our Jury Box meals in one of two ways: cash from our own pockets, or charging it to the client whose matter we were working on. We were supposed to do this only when working late and bringing dinner to our desks, but a lot of lawyers just charged their meals whenever they felt like it. This meant that Microsoft might be springing for your breakfast bagel, while Time Warner picked up your turkey club at lunch. I always just paid cash. It was faster, not to mention more honest. <br>I picked up my tray, entered the dining room, and surveyed my options. <br>Jeff Murphy half-stood from his table, waving me over to where he sat with Hunter Russell, another associate in our class. Good old Murph. He was one of my best friends at the firm. We&#x2019;d shared an office as summer associates, exactly nine years ago this month. Frankly, I hadn&#x2019;t expected to like him much at first. I&#x2019;d taken one look and assumed he&#x2019;d be too entitled for my taste, the worst kind of irritating, backslapping, how-the-hell-are-you frat boy. But he&#x2019;d grown on me. Murph was a smart guy, despite the rich jock pedigree. <br>I set my tray down next to his on the starched white tablecloth and pulled out a chair. I nodded at Hunter, who barely glanced my way, thumbs frantically working the keys of his BlackBerry. Hunter loved his BlackBerry. It gave him the appearance of responding to urgent client messages while he checked his Fantasy League Baseball stats. <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s up, Yung?&#x201d; said Murph, jostling my elbow. He grinned at me, and I looked sidelong back at him. <br>Murph was a good-looking guy, and he knew it. I was reminded of this once again, seeing him in his crisp white dress shirt, open at the throat, sleeves rolled up, his tanned, muscular forearms lying easily on the table. His wavy, dark blond hair just brushed the top of his collar, and his new tan set off his eyes to brilliant effect, making them look even greener than usual. Murph&#x2019;s family had a house on the Cape, and he spent a week there every Memorial Day. He&#x2019;d just gotten back, and he practically glowed with privilege and well-being. <br>Murph and I had once had something of a moment, you might say, years ago. When you hire ninety-five young, smart, attractive, ambitious people every fall, who&#x2019;ve all just graduated from the same five law schools and landed in Manhattan, and then make them work twenty hours a day together in close quarters, there&#x2019;s obviously going to be sexual tension. Back when we were first-years, Murph had thrown a huge Halloween party at the loft he shared in Tribeca with one of his college buddies. I hadn&#x2019;t really wanted to go, and I didn&#x2019;t have a costume, but all the other associates in our class were going, and there was nothing I hated more than feeling left out. <br>So at the last minute, I rushed from work to my apartment and threw on my high school prom dress&#x2014;the one I&#x2019;d worn the night I&#x2019;d been crowned Potomac Valley High&#x2019;s first-ever Asian American prom queen. (Oh my! Mrs. Saltzstein, the guidance counselor, had gushed. She&#x2019;d heard of Oriental valedictorians before, but never a Chinese prom queen!) The dress was a strapless pink taffeta number. The zipper took some coaxing, and I was mushrooming a little out the top, but damn if I didn&#x2019;t still look pretty good in that thing. <br>By the time I cabbed downtown to Murph&#x2019;s loft, the party was in full swing. <br>&#x201c;Yung!&#x201d; said a very drunk Murph upon greeting me at the door. He was dressed as Pope John Paul II. We air-kissed&#x2014;funny how being at a party makes it okay to air-kiss your co-workers&#x2014;and he led me to the drinks in the kitchen. Many hours and margaritas later, Murph, Hunter, Hunter&#x2019;s wife, and I were huddled around his CD collection (this being before the iPod age) and someone put on &#x201c;Son of a Preacher Man.&#x201d; Murph looked at me, bleary-eyed, and said, &#x201c;Yung. What <i>are</i> you wearing?&#x201d; I batted my lashes and purred, &#x201c;My prom dress.&#x201d; Hunter&#x2019;s wife threw back her head and laughed. &#x201c;What about some fake hickeys? You can&#x2019;t be a prom queen without the hickeys!&#x201d; <br>Without missing a beat, Murph volunteered to provide the real thing, and before I could think better of it, Murph bent over my bare neck and shoulder and did the honors while I leaned back against his Sharper Image CD tower. I remember being surprised at the warmth of him, and how good the burr of his late-night stubble felt against my skin. It tickled, and I was laughing, and Dusty Springfield was singing that being good isn&#x2019;t always easy, but when Murph stood back up and gazed at me with a deadly serious, intensely hopeful look on his face, I realized I&#x2019;d made a grave mistake. Sure enough, later that night, as Murph helped me look for my coat among the huge pile on his bed, he fixed me with a solemn if drunken gaze and leaned in toward me at a deliberate angle. I gently disentangled myself and pretended to laugh it off. &#x201c;If only you weren&#x2019;t dressed as the pope,&#x201d; I&#x2019;d said, the easiest way I could think of to let him down lightly. This was <i>Murph,</i> after all; he was like my brother. Furthermore, everyone at work knew he was an incorrigible flirt. Monday morning we both acted like it had just been the tequila talking. That had been eight years ago. We&#x2019;d never spoken of it since. <br>&#x201c;Health food?&#x201d; Murph asked now, nodding toward my plate. <br>&#x201c;Shut up, it&#x2019;s delicious,&#x201d; I told him, and took a huge bite of lasagna. <br>I did not appreciate Murph or anyone else scrutinizing what I was eating. It always felt, just a tiny bit, like I was back in my fourth-grade cafeteria, shyly unwrapping the scallion pancake or shrimp toast my mother would pack in aluminum foil in my lunchbox. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s <i>that</i>?&#x201d; Becky Noble would wrinkle up her nose, her own tidy baloney-and-cheese sandwich raised halfway to her mouth, causing all of the other girls to giggle. Years later, on a blind date at the Campbell Apartment, my twenty-dollar martini had arrived alongside an appetizer of those same scallion pancakes, cut into dainty bite-size triangles and served with a ginger-soy dipping sauce. My blind date&#x2014;an anesthesiologist named Ethan&#x2014;pushed them toward me. &#x201c;Try one. These things are amazing,&#x201d; he enthused, popping one into his mouth. &#x201c;They <i>are</i> good, aren&#x2019;t they,&#x201d; I replied, smiling vaguely and wondering what had ever happened to Becky Noble. <br>Murph shook his head at me. &#x201c;I swear I&#x2019;ve never seen a woman eat so much and still be a size two, Yung.&#x201d; <br>I shrugged. <br>Here was another thing about all the male attorneys I worked with. They all called me by my last name, Yung, instead of by my first name, Ingrid. I wondered if some of them even knew what my first name was. But I didn&#x2019;t mind this. I&#x2019;d been in the corporate world long enough to know that it was a good sign. When they felt comfortable enough to swear like sailors around me, I knew I was finally in. <br>I looked over at Hunter. He was hunched over a piece of paper, scribbling on some sort of cryptic sketch that looked like a tree. <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; I asked. <br>&#x201c;Huh?&#x201d; Hunter looked up. &#x201c;Oh. I&#x2019;m doing our softball brackets. See?&#x201d; He slid the paper toward me. &#x201c;This is how the season&#x2019;s shaping up. Wachtell&#x2019;s out. All we have to do now is beat Simpson Thacher in two weeks. And trust me, we will. They suck this year. So if Davis Polk takes down Skadden next week, and then they knock out the DA&#x2019;s office after that, we&#x2019;ll face them in the finals.&#x201d; He beamed. <br>Murph looked at me. &#x201c;Glad you asked?&#x201d; <br>Hunter was captain of our firm&#x2019;s softball team, the Parsons Valentine Prosecutors, and he was obsessed with winning the Central Park Lawyers League championship trophy. He spent twice as much time on softball captain duties as he did on legal work, but Hunter could afford to. He was pretty much unfireable. Nine years ago, during his final year of law school, he&#x2019;d had the good fortune to knock up the daughter of a longtime Parsons Valentine client. This bank CFO had promptly forwarded Hunter&#x2019;s r�sum� to the head partner in our Corporate Department with a lunch invitation and a handwritten note, gently suggesting that his new son-in-law was sure to be an asset to any firm. Hunter was hired the following week. He&#x2019;d been here ever since, billing about two-thirds of the hours the rest of us did. We grudgingly accepted him in our midst. We knew they&#x2019;d never actually make him a partner&#x2014;the firm was too worried about malpractice for that&#x2014;but he was assured a cushy job as a senior associate or Of Counsel for as long as his father-in-law&#x2019;s bank kept paying its bills. <br>&#x201c;A word to the wise,&#x201d; Murph said in a lowered voice. &#x201c;I hear Adler&#x2019;s looking to staff some monster deal. If you see him around, look busy.&#x201d; <br>We usually got assigned to deals at the Corporate Department meetings, so the process could appear fair and transparent, but sometimes partners just randomly trolled the halls looking for help. If you had too clean a desk or were blatantly surfing the Web when a partner poked his head in your office, you&#x2019;d be slapped with a new deal. This was known, resentfully, as drive-by assigning. <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not Adler&#x2019;s MO,&#x201d; I said. Marty Adler was the top rainmaking partner at Parsons Valentine, the real deal. He didn&#x2019;t need to troll the halls. Associates wanted to work with him. If he liked you, he could make your whole career. <br>Murph shrugged. &#x201c;Look, believe what you want. I&#x2019;m just the messenger.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Speak of the devil.&#x201d; I nodded toward the other side of the room. Marty Adler, Harold Rubinstein, Sid Cantrell, and Jack Hanover&#x2014;heavy hitters, all of them members of the firm&#x2019;s Management Committee&#x2014;were rising from a table and pocketing their BlackBerrys. (Partners left their trays on the table for the dining room staff to clean up. Associates bused our own.) We all watched as this gang of four exited the Jury Box through the glass doors and stood talking in front of the elevators. Adler was gesticulating wildly about something. The others were nodding in agreement, apparently unaware that all of the associates were looking on. <br>I took another bite of lasagna. This brand of naked, unabashed partner worship amused me. We were senior associates, on the verge of our own partnership votes, and yet we still accorded the partners a distant, irreverent kind of celebrity&#x2014;sort of like the way kids talked about their teachers in junior high. Partners walked among us. We worked alongside them. We talked to them every day. But despite this charade of equal footing, they remained shrouded in mystery. They were beings to be scrutinized and revered, hated and loved&#x2014;and gossiped about. We were all expected to call them by their first names to their faces, but in private, we bandied about their last names only, as if they were baseball trading cards. <br>We watched as the four partners disappeared into an elevator. <br>&#x201c;Well, back to the grind,&#x201d; said Murph, balling up his napkin and tossing it onto his tray. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a ton of shit to do today.&#x201d; <br>Hunter pushed his chair back from the table and stood. &#x201c;Yeah, I guess I should get going, too.&#x201d; <br>Murph glanced at me. &#x201c;Hey, you don&#x2019;t mind, do you? You want us to sit with you til you&#x2019;re done?&#x201d; Actually, I did mind. Eating alone in the Jury Box made me feel like my cover had been blown. But I couldn&#x2019;t tell them that. &#x201c;Go, go, I don&#x2019;t mind,&#x201d; I said, shooing them away. &#x201c;See you guys later.&#x201d; <br>I took two more bites of Mason&#x2019;s spicy three-cheese lasagna and stood to bus my tray. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>My office was on the thirty-first floor, along with those of the other senior M&amp;A associates. Hunter&#x2019;s office was the first I passed on my way from the elevator bank. HUNTER F. RUSSELL <i>,</i> read the polished brass nameplate. Next to Hunter was Murph, and next to Murph was a seventh-year named Todd Ames, who&#x2019;d had his name legally changed from Abramowicz while still in law school. For ease of spelling, I&#x2019;d once heard him explain. <br>Hunter&#x2019;s, Murph&#x2019;s, and Todd&#x2019;s offices were all clustered together on the good side of the building, in a stretch of hallway known as Fraternity Row. They had scored these sweet offices with their panoramic views by flirting shamelessly with the firm&#x2019;s office logistics coordinator, Liz Borkofsky. It was rumored that Liz had taken this job in hopes of snagging a male attorney, any male attorney, on track for partner. Finally, last winter, she&#x2019;d gotten engaged to the firm&#x2019;s slightly shy, balding director of IT. The joke went around the office that Liz had slept her way to the middle. <br>I rounded the corner and got to my own office. It was nice enough, but it faced Madison Avenue, not the park. I&#x2019;d tried to make it a comfortable place to spend my waking hours, since we did spend almost all of them here. I&#x2019;d brought in a cheerful vase that I kept filled with fresh flowers. Vintage travel posters for the walls. And a framed photograph of the Manhattan skyline that I&#x2019;d once taken from the Brooklyn Bridge. <br>Margo was just getting back from her lunch break. Ridiculously, secretaries were not allowed to eat in the attorney dining room. Margo brought sandwiches from home and ate them in the park. <br>&#x201c;Hey, Margo,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;How is it outside?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Hot and crowded,&#x201d; she said, sighing. &#x201c;All those European tourists, you know. They get th...</p><h2>The Civil War: A Visual History (DK Definitive Visual Histories)</h2><p>A fascinating and complete guide to the Civil War, this book includes compelling information on the War between the States, Abraham Lincoln, slavery in America, the Confederacy and the Union.

The seven chapters are arranged chronologically, beginning with an overview of slavery in the United States, 1815 to 1860, and ending with a survey of the legacies of the conflict during the period 1865 to 1877. The narrative and illustrations highlight all of the issues surrounding the war, including the first shots fired at Bull Run, the blockade of the South, the question of border states, important battles, soldiers' uniforms and weapons, African Americans' roles, the importance of the railroad, photography, Abraham Lincoln's assassination, and Reconstruction. Chapter introductions are followed by illustrated time lines and by short topical divisions that include biographies, maps, original documents or eyewitness accounts, illustrations, historical photographs, artifacts, and reproductions of paintings.

Jack sat reading in front of the living room fire.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Who wants hot chocolate?&#x201d; his dad called from the kitchen.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Me, please!&#x201d; said Jack.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The front door burst open, and with a gust of cold wind, Annie rushed inside. &#x201c;Jack! Guess what!&#x201d; she whispered. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s back!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;How do you know?&#x201d; said Jack.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I was walking home from the library&#x201d;&#x2014; Annie paused to catch her breath&#x2014;&#x201c;and I saw a flash in the sky above the woods. The last time that happened&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Before she could finish the sentence, Jack jumped up. &#x201c;Dad, Annie and I are going to go outside for a while!&#x201d; he shouted. &#x201c;Can the hot chocolate wait till we get back?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sure, have fun!&#x201d; their dad called from the kitchen.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I have to get my pack,&#x201d; Jack said to Annie. &#x201c;Meet you on the porch.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t forget the rhyme book!&#x201d; said Annie.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Annie slipped outside and Jack ran up to his room. He grabbed his backpack. He checked to make sure their book of magic rhymes was inside. <i>Good</i>, there it was.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jack charged back downstairs. He pulled on his boots, put on his jacket, tied a scarf around his neck, grabbed his mittens, and headed out the door.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Come on!&#x201d; said Annie.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jack could see his breath in the cold air. &#x201c;Brrr,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s hurry!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jack and Annie ran down the street and into the Frog Creek woods. They wove between the trees, their boots crunching through the fallen leaves.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jack stopped. The magic tree house was back. High in a tall oak tree, it was silhouetted against the gray November sky. &#x201c;You were right,&#x201d; he said to Annie. &#x201c;Good work.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; Annie said. She ran to the rope ladder and started up. Jack followed her.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> When they climbed inside the tree house, Jack and Annie saw a book and a scroll of parchment paper lying on the floor. Annie picked up the scroll, unrolled it, and read aloud.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Dear Jack and Annie of Frog Creek,</i><br> <i>I am sending you on one more mission to prove that you can use magic wisely. This poem will guide you.</i><br> <i>&#x2014;M.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>The very last unicorn </i><br><i> Is now hidden well</i><br><i> By those who have put him </i><br><i> Under a spell.</i><br> &nbsp;<br><i> Four centuries, four decades </i><br><i> From that afternoon,</i><br><i> At the end of November, </i><br><i> Before the blue moon,</i><br> &nbsp;<br><i> He will wake once more </i><br><i> And be free to go home </i><br><i> If you call out his name: </i><br><i> Divine Flower of Rome.</i><br> &nbsp;<br><i> You must coax him to stand </i><br><i> Once his name is spoken.</i><br><i> His chain will break</i><br><i> And the spell, too, be broken.</i><br> &nbsp;<br><i> Then a young girl must love him </i><br><i> And show him the way,</i><br><i> Lest he be trapped forever </i><br><i> On public display.</i><br> &nbsp;<br><i> If he loses this chance </i><br><i> To rise and depart, </i><br><i> All magic will fade</i><br><i> From his horn and his heart.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A unicorn!&#x201d; breathed Annie. &#x201c;I love him already. <i>I&#x2019;ll</i> show him the way!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But this poem is really hard to understand,&#x201d; said Jack. &#x201c;What kind of research book did Morgan send us?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> He picked up the book that had been left for them by Morgan le Fay, the librarian of Camelot. The cover showed a row of skyscrapers. The title was <i>New York City Guide Book, 1938</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;New York City?&#x201d; said Annie. &#x201c;I love New York City! Remember the great time we had there with Aunt Mallory?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yeah, I love it, too,&#x201d; said Jack. &#x201c;But why would there be a unicorn in New York City in 1938? A unicorn is an ancient fantasy creature. New York City&#x2019;s a real place, and 1938 is not even that long ago.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; said Annie. &#x201c;It sounds like a hard mission. But don&#x2019;t forget we have Teddy and Kathleen&#x2019;s magic rhymes to help us.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; said Jack. He pulled out the book given to them by their friends Teddy and Kathleen, two young enchanters of Camelot. &#x201c;The problem is, we can only use each rhyme once, and we&#x2019;ve already used seven out of the ten.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Which means we still have three left,&#x201d; said Annie. &#x201c;What are they?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;<i>Pull a Cloud from the Sky</i>,&#x201d; said Jack. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Cool,&#x201d; said Annie.<br> &#x201c;Yeah, it is,&#x201d; said Jack. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m not sure it will be much use.&#x201d; He looked back at the book. &#x201c;<i>Find a Treasure You Must Never Lose</i>,&#x201d; he said. <br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hey, that&#x2019;s a really good one!&#x201d; said Annie. &#x201c;The unicorn&#x2019;s a treasure. So that rhyme could<br> take care of our whole mission.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But it only partly fits,&#x201d; said Jack. &#x201c;You could call the unicorn a treasure. But once we find him, we have to lose him. He has to go back home.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh, right... ,&#x201d; said Annie. &#x201c;What else?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Your favorite,&#x201d; said Jack. &#x201c;<i>Turn into Ducks</i>.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Annie laughed. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t wait to use that one!&#x201d; she said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I hope we <i>never</i> use that one,&#x201d; said Jack. He didn&#x2019;t want to waddle around and quack like a duck. &#x201c;These leftover rhymes don&#x2019;t seem very helpful to me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, let&#x2019;s just wait and see,&#x201d; said Annie. &#x201c;But now . . . &#x201d; She held up Morgan&#x2019;s research book and smiled.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jack nodded. &#x201c;New York City, here we come,&#x201d; he said. He pointed at the book&#x2019;s cover. &#x201c;I wish we could go <i>there</i>!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The wind started to blow.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The tree house started to spin. It spun faster and faster.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Then everything was still. Absolutely still.</p><h2>Night of Soldiers and Spies (Ranger in Time #10)</h2><p><b>Ranger, the time-traveling golden retriever with search-and-rescue training, travels to Colonial America to help the patriot cause!</b><br><br>Ranger's next mission finds him in the middle of the Revolutionary War.

It is reprinted with all of the references in the New King James Version of the Bible and the updated language adopted by the Synod of the RCUS in 2011. This small book is one of the finest fruits of the Reformation and epitomizes its essential teaching. Holding forth faith in Jesus Christ as our only comfort in life and in death, it presents, very personally and eloquently, what is necessary to know that we may live and die in that comfort. While many played a role in its composition, it was especially Zacharias Ursinus and Caspar Olevianus who imparted its theological content and practical spirit. Having received hearty approval by the pastors and teachers in Heidelberg, it was published on January 19, 1563. Its influence in Germany, the Netherlands, Hungary, and beyond exceeded all expectations. It was welcomed by Reformed believers everywhere. Today, those who are yearning for a beautiful statement of biblical truth will find this work a treasure. It remains as fresh as when it was first published 450 years ago.</p><p></p><h2>Tabbed Board Books: My First Animals: Let&#39;s Squeak and Squawk!

Suddenly nothing is as it once seemed; you can trust no one, maybe not even yourself. It is exactly this revelation that turns 14-year-old Adam Farmer's life upside down. As he tries to ascertain who he really is, Adam encounters a past, present, and future too horrible to contemplate. Suspense builds as the fragments of the story are assembled--a missing father, government corruption, espionage--until the shocking conclusion shatters the fragile mosaic.

I would recommend this book to any father or husband who desires to step up to the challenge presented by Dr. Mason.&nbsp;<b>Tommy Bowden</b>Former college football coach and now a featured analyst on The NEW College Football Show on FOX Sports South&nbsp;I have been a friend and fan of Dr. Eric Mason for over a decade. I could not be more excited about his voice speaking into what I believe is the most critical issue of our day, the state of our men. <i>Manhood Restored </i>is a powerful resource that will help men of all ages understand the problems men create and how they can get on the solution side. The ideas and truths in this book are not just detached ideals written from an ivory tower . . . I have watched Eric work out his own masculinity in a powerful way as a husband, father, church planter, church leader, movement leader, and good friend.&nbsp;<b>Dr. John W. Bryson</b>Cofounder, Pastor Fellowship Memphis and lead writer, Co-Presenter 33 the Series&nbsp;Eric Mason has written a practical, biblical, and gospel- centered vision of true manhood. Saturated in the person and work of the Lord Jesus Christ, our perfect model of true manhood, Mason carefully addresses an essential key to changing our churches and communities&#x2014;the discipleship of men. Read this book, brother, and watch the Lord change your life. Share it and watch the Lord change the brothers in your sphere of influence.&nbsp;<b>H. B. Charles Jr.</b>Pastor/Teacher at the Shiloh Metropolitan Baptist Church, Jacksonville, Florida&nbsp;Sin is social. Even the most private and individual of sins&#x2014; wallowing in porn, for example&#x2014;are never merely individual. Devouring porn may be an individual offense, but it is also an insult to God&#x2014;and because it works out in perverted or abusive or manipulative relationships, it is also social. That is why the gospel, in all its massive power, does not only reconcile us to God, but so transforms us that healthy relationships begin to bud all around us: the shattered social fabric begins to be healed. Perhaps no human relationships are more broken today than those within the family, within what used to be the family. And most frightening of all are the sad realities bound up with absent or abusive or selfish fathers. I gratefully applaud the ministry of Eric Mason as he seeks to apply the whole counsel of God to form Christian men, Christian husbands, Christian fathers, who in gospel grace and joy take up the reins of responsibility and faithful service to stamp new generations with a passion for strong, self-sacrificing love and holiness.&nbsp;<b>D. A. Carson</b>Research professor of New Testament at Trinity Evangelical Seminary, Deerfield, Illinois&nbsp;Pastor Eric Mason is a man I have known and respected for many years. He has planted and is leading a fast growing Bible teaching city reaching church in a rough Philly neighborhood. I&#x2019;m excited to see this book released as it blends his rare skill set as a first rate formally trained theologian who is literally on the front lines of urban ministry.&nbsp;<b>Mark Driscoll</b>Founding Pastor of Mars Hill ChurchFounder of The Resurgence, Cofounder of Acts 29<i>New York Times </i>#1 best-selling author&nbsp;In this age of increasing confusion about manhood, marriage and God&#x2019;s Word, Eric Mason has emerged as a refreshing, clear and prophetic voice. This book not only speaks to today&#x2019;s urban youth, it also powerfully speaks to all who have concerns about the general direction of our society. For anyone cares about applying God&#x2019;s truth to contemporary challenges, <i>Manhood Restored </i>is a must reed.&nbsp;<b>Dr. Carl Ellis Jr.</b>Assistant Professor of Practical Theology, Redeemer Seminary<br>Manhood has fallen on hard times. So many men have been beaten-up by the past, mired in the consequences of &nbsp;bad choices, and confused and disoriented by a culture committed to redefining manhood so that we can cover the fractures and disguise the torment. That&#x2019;s why I am thrilled for the gift of <i>Manhood Restored</i>. &nbsp;What a clear, compelling portrait of the power of the gospel to transform broken males into whole, godly men. You have pointed us to the Savior who makes all things new. This is our hope and our courage.&nbsp;<b>Dr. Crawford W. Loritts Jr. </b><br>Author, speaker, radio host<br>Senior Pastor, Fellowship Bible Church, Roswell, Georgia&nbsp;Few issues fire me up like the topic of men acting like men. My friend and ministry partner Eric Mason offers hope to, incites healing for, and wreaks havoc on men. Every man who follows Jesus needs to read this book and apply the biblical truth in it to his life. The men in our churches, the marriages in our churches, and our churches will be better for it.&nbsp;<b>James MacDonald</b>Senior Pastor of Harvest Bible ChapelAuthor of <i>Vertical Church</i>&nbsp;There is no greater need in our day than to answer two questions: What is a man? and What is a godly man? In this helpful and biblical book, Eric Mason answers these questions. If you are a man, read and heed this great work.&nbsp;<b>Dr. Darrin Patrick</b>Lead Pastor of The Journey, St. Louis, MissouriAuthor of <i>For the City</i>, <i>Church Planter: The Man, The Message, The Mission</i>, and A <i>Dude&#x2019;s Guide to Manhood: Finding True Manliness in a World Of Counterfeits</i>&nbsp;As parents of three boys, we are praying that each will live God honoring lives, realize their God-given potential and reach their God-given destiny. This will only happen if a clear course&#x2014;a map of manhood&#x2014;is drawn out for them to follow. <i>Manhood Restored </i>is a tool that will not only help grown men live well but also serve as a compass for the next generation. Our friend Eric Mason writes from experience. We&#x2019;ve admired him as a faithful husband and father, disciplined student of God&#x2019;s Word and dedicated servant of the Lord His integrity and wisdom shine through on every page. Men of all ages should read this book and treasure its truths deeply in their souls.&nbsp;<b>Jerry and Priscilla Shirer</b>Bible teacher and Author&nbsp;From the moment God formed man, we were charged with possessing God&#x2019;s essence and reflecting His character. Throughout history, this intended role of a man has gradually shifted to a view that&#x2019;s now become common&#x2014;the notion that a man&#x2019;s merit is predicated on his worldly success, by all means. We have become consumed with being THE man instead of A man. True &#x201c;Manhood&#x201d; has lost the real prerequisite, an intimate relationship with God! A team captain cannot effectively lead without being a ref lection of the coach. When men re-establish our connection with our creator, we see the fruit&#x2014;healthier families, stronger communities, a society with substance, and world leaders who are equipped with integrity and purpose.&nbsp;<b>Allan Houston</b>New York Knicks&nbsp;<br></p><h2>War of the Wolf: A Novel (Saxon Tales) (Saxon Tales, 11)</h2><p><p><strong>Bernard Cornwell&#x2019;s epic story of the making of England continues in this eleventh installment in the bestselling Saxon Tales series&#x2015;"like <em>Game of Thrones</em>, but real" (<em>The Observer</em>)&#x2015;the basis of the hit Netflix television series <em>The Last Kingdom.</em></strong></p><p><em>His blood is Saxon<br></em><em>His heart is Viking<br></em><em>His battleground is England</em></p><p>"Perhaps the greatest writer of historical adventure novels today" (<em>Washington Post</em>), Bernard Cornwell has dazzled and entertained readers and critics with his page-turning bestsellers.

Between its three successive locations in Weimar, Dessau and Berlin, the school fostered charismatic and creative exchange between teachers and students, all varied in their artistic styles and preferences, but united in their idealism and their interest in a &#x201c;total&#x201d; work of art across different practices and media.</p><p>This book celebrates the adventurous innovation of the Bauhaus movement, both as a trailblazer in the development of modernism, and as a paradigm of art education, where an all-encompassing freedom of creative expression and cutting-edge ideas led to functional and beautiful creations.</p></p><p>Magdalena Droste a �tudi� l&#x2019;histoire de l&#x2019;art et la litt�rature � Aix-la-Chapelle et Marbourg. � partir de 1980, elle travaille aux archives du Bauhaus � Berlin, puis comme professeur d&#x2019;histoire de l&#x2019;art � la BTU Cottbus.

He was educated at Eton College and later spent a formative period studying languages in Europe. His first job was with Reuters News Agency where a Moscow posting gave him firsthand experience with what would become his literary <i>bete noire</i>&#x2014;the Soviet Union. During World War II he served as Assistant to the Director of Naval Intelligence and played a key role in Allied espionage operations. <p>After the war he worked as foreign manager of the <i>Sunday Times</i>, a job that allowed him to spend two months each year in Jamaica. Here, in 1952, at his home &#x201c;Goldeneye,&#x201d; he wrote a book called <i>Casino Royale</i>&#x2014;and James Bond was born. The first print run sold out within a month. For the next twelve years Fleming produced a novel a year featuring Special Agent 007, the most famous spy of the century. His travels, interests, and wartime experience lent authority to everything he wrote. Raymond Chandler described him as &#x201c;the most forceful and driving writer of thrillers in England.&#x201d; Sales soared when President Kennedy named the fifth title, <i>From Russia With Love</i>, one of his favorite books. The Bond novels have sold more than one hundred million copies worldwide, boosted by the hugely successful film franchise that began in 1962 with the release of <i>Dr. No</i>. </p><p>He married Anne Rothermere in 1952. His story about a magical car, written in 1961 for their only son Caspar, went on to become the well- loved novel and film <i>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</i>. </p><p>Fleming died of heart failure on August 12, 1964, at the age of fifty-six.</p><p><b>1. SEASCAPE WITH FIGURES</b></p> <p>The five-mile promenade of Royale-les-Eaux, backed by trim lawns emblazoned at intervals with tricolour beds of salvia, alyssum and lobelia, was bright with flags and, on the longest beach in the north of France, the gay bathing tents still marched prettily down to the tide-line in big, money-making battalions. Music, one of those lilting accordion waltzes, blared from the loud-speakers around the Olympic-size piscine and, from time to time, echoing above the music, a man's voice announced over the public address system that Phil-ippe Bertrand, aged seven, was looking for his mother, that Yolande Lefevre was waiting for her friends below the clock at the entrance, or that a Madame Dufours was demanded on the telephone. From the beach, particularly from the neighbourhood of the three play-ground enclosures - 'Joie de Vivre', 'Helio' and 'Azur' - came a twitter of children's cries that waxed and waned with the thrill of their games and, farther out, on the firm sand left by the now distant sea, the shrill whistle of the physical-fitness instructor marshalled his teenagers through the last course of the day.</p> <p>It was one of those beautiful, naive seaside panoramas for which the Brittany and Picardy beaches have provided the setting - and inspired their recorders, Boudin, Tissot, Monet - ever since the birth of plages and bains de mer more than a hundred years ago.</p> <p>To James Bond, sitting in one of the concrete shelters with his face to the setting sun, there was something poignant, ephemeral about it all. It reminded him almost too vividly of childhood - of the velvet feel of the hot powder sand, and the painful grit of wet sand between young toes when the time came for him to put his shoes and socks on, of the precious little pile of sea-shells and interesting wrack on the sill of his bedroom window ('No, we'll have to leave that behind, darling. It'll dirty up your trunk!'), of the small crabs scuttling away from the nervous fingers groping beneath the seaweed in the rock-pools, of the swimming and swimming and swimming through the dancing waves -always in those days it seemed, lit with sunshine - and then the infuriating, inevitable 'time to come out'. It was all there, his own childhood, spread out before him to have another look at. What a long time ago they were, those spade-and-bucket days! How far he had come since the freckles and the Cadbury milk chocolate Flakes and the fizzy lemonade! Impatiently Bond lit a cigarette, pulled his shoulders out of their slouch and slammed the mawkish memories back into their long-closed file. Today he was a grown-up, a man with years of dirty, dangerous memories - a spy. He was not sitting in this concrete hideout to sentimentalise about a pack of scrubby, smelly children on a beach scattered with bottle-tops and lolly-sticks and fringed by a sea thick with sun-oil and putrid with the main drains of Royale. He was here, he had chosen to be here, to spy. To spy on a woman.</p> <p>The sun was getting lower. Already one could smell the September chill that all day had lain hidden beneath the heat. The cohorts of bathers were in quick retreat, striking their little camps and filtering up the steps and across the promenade into the shelter of the town where the lights were going up in the cafes. The announcer at the swimming-pool harried his customers: 'Allo! Allo! Fermeture en dix minutes! A dix-huit heures, fermeture de la piscine!' Silhouetted in the path of the setting sun, the two Bombard rescue-boats with flags bearing a blue cross on a yellow background were speeding northwards for their distant shelter up-river in the Vieux Port. The last of the gay, giraffe-like sand-yachts fled down the distant water-line towards its corral among the sand dunes, and the three agents cyclistes in charge of the car-parks pedalled away through the melting ranks of cars towards the police station in the centre of the town. In a matter of minutes the vast expanse of sand - the tide, still receding, was already a mile out - would be left to the seagulls that would soon be flocking in their hordes to forage for the scraps of food left by the picnickers. Then the orange ball of the sun would hiss down into the sea and the beach would, for a while, be entirely deserted, until, under cover of darkness, the prowling lovers would come to writhe briefly, grittily in the dark corners between the bathing-huts and the sea-wall.</p> <p>On the beaten stretch of sand below where James Bond was sitting, two golden girls in exciting bikinis packed up the game of Jokari which they had been so provocatively playing, and raced each other up the steps towards Bond's shelter. They flaunted their bodies at him, paused and chattered to see if he would respond, and, when he didn't, linked arms and sauntered on towards the town, leaving Bond wondering why it was that French girls had more prominent navels than any others. Was it that French surgeons sought to add, even in this minute respect, to the future sex-appeal of girl babies?</p> <p>And now, up and down the beach, the lifeguards gave a final blast on their horns to announce that they were going off duty, the music from the piscine stopped in mid-tune and the great expanse of sand was suddenly deserted.</p> <p>But not quite! A hundred yards out, lying face down-wards on a black and white striped bathing-wrap, on the private patch of firm sand where she had installed herself an hour before, the girl was still there, motion-less, spread-eagled in direct line between James Bond and the setting sun that was now turning the left-behind pools and shallow rivulets into blood-red, meandering scrawls across the middle distance. Bond went on watching her - now, in the silence and emptiness, with an ounce more tension. He was waiting for her to do something - for something, he didn't know what, to happen. It would be more true to say that he was watching over her. He had an instinct that she was in some sort of danger. Or was it just that there was the smell of danger in the air? He didn't know. He only knew that he mustn't leave her alone, particularly now that everyone else had gone.</p> <p>James Bond was mistaken. Not everyone else had gone. Behind him, at the Cafe de la Plage on the other side of the promenade, two men in raincoats and dark caps sat at a secluded table bordering the sidewalk. They had half-empty cups of coffee in front of them and they didn't talk. They sat and watched the blur on the frosted-glass partition of the shelter that was James Bond's head and shoulders. They also watched, but less intently, the distant white blur on the sand that was the girl. Their stillness, and their unseasonable clothes, would have made a disquieting impression on anyone who, in his turn, might have been watching them. But there was no such person, except their waiter who had simply put them in the category of 'bad news' and hoped they would soon be on their way.</p> <p>When the lower rim of the orange sun touched the sea, it was almost as if a signal had sounded for the girl. She slowly got to her feet, ran both hands backwards through her hair and began to walk evenly, purposefully towards the sun and the far-away froth of the water-line over a mile away. It would be violet dusk by the time she reached the sea and one might have guessed that this was probably the last day of her holiday, her last bathe.</p> <p>James Bond thought otherwise. He left his shelter, ran down the steps to the sand and began walking out after her at a fast pace. Behind him, across the promenade, the two men in raincoats also seemed to think otherwise. One of them briskly threw down some coins and they both got up and, walking strictly in step, crossed the promenade to the sand and, with a kind of urgent military precision, marched rapidly side by side in Bond's tracks.</p> <p>Now the strange pattern of figures on the vast expanse of empty, blood-streaked sand was eerily conspicuous. Yet it was surely not one to be interfered with! The pattern had a nasty, a secret smell. The white girl, the bare-headed young man, the two squat, marching pursuers - it had something of a kind of deadly Grand-mother's Steps about it. In the cafe, the waiter collected the coins and looked after the distant figures, still outlined by the last quarter of the orange sun. It smelt like police business - or the other thing. He would keep it to himself but remember it. He might get his name in the papers.</p> <p>James Bond was rapidly catching up with the girl. Now he knew that he would get to her just as she reached the waterline. He began to wonder what he would say to her, how he would put it. He couldn't say, 'I had a hunch you were going to commit suicide so I came after you to stop you.' 'I was going for a walk on the beach and I thought I recognised you. Will you have a drink after your swim?' would be childish. He l finally decided to say,' Oh, Tracy!' and then, when she turned round, 'I was worried about you.' Which would at least be inoffensive and, for the matter of that, true.</p> <p>The sea was now gunmetal below a primrose horizon. A small, westerly offshore breeze, drawing the hot land-air out to sea, had risen and was piling up wavelets that scrolled in whitely as far as the eye could see. Flocks of herring gulls lazily rose and settled again at the girl's approach, and the air was full of their mewing and of the endless lap-lap of the small waves. The soft indigo dusk added a touch of melancholy to the empty solitude of sand and sea, now so far away from the comforting bright lights and holiday bustle of 'La Reine de la Cote Opale', as Royale-les-Eaux had splendidly christened herself. Bond looked forward to getting the girl back to those bright lights. He watched the lithe golden figure in the white one-piece bathing-suit and wondered how soon she would be able to hear his voice above the noise of the gulls and the sea. Her pace had slowed a fraction as she approached the water-line and her head, with its bell of heavy fair hair to the shoulders, was slightly bowed, in thought perhaps, or tiredness.</p> <p>Bond quickened his step until he was on...</p></p><h2>Mission Rome: A Scavenger Hunt Adventure (Travel Guide For Kids)</h2><p><p><b>Headed to Rome with kids?

The book was primarily for chemists. The writing of it was commenced in order that a textbook might be available for the use of students in the course in powder and explosives which the author gave for about twenty years (nearly every year since the first World War) to fourth-year and graduate students of chemistry and of chemical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.... The aim of the book has been too described as clearly and interestingly as possible and as fully as seemed profitable the modes of behavior, both physical and chemical, of explosive substances, whether these modes find practical application or not. Historical material has been included where it was thought that it contributed to this end, and has not been included elsewhere or for any other reason. It is a fact that a knowledge of the history of ideas, of persons, or of things produces something of the same sympathetic understanding of them that living with them and working with them does. --- excerpts from book&#39;s Preface</p><p></p><h2>Midnight Mass (Priest)</h2><p><p>We are told that God will punish the wicked.

After living in Seattle and Florida, the family moved to Portland, Oregon, where Jim began his piano studies with Frances Mulkey North. Subsequently, Jim studied with the late Ariel Rubstein, the late Louis Artau, and the late Gyorgy Sandor.<br><br>Jim received his undergraduate and masters degrees from Southern Methodist University. He was a former member of the faculties of Notre Dame University, Tulane University, Loyola University (New Orleans), and the summer faculties of Tanglewood and the National Music Camp at Interlochen, Michigan.<br><br>Jim met his wife Jane Smisor in New Orleans in 1960. They performed as the duo-piano team, Smisor and Bastien. In addition, Jim was a Columbia Artist accompanist whose collaborative career included appearances with Richard Tucker and John Alexander. During this time Jim and Jane started writing music to address the needs of their students. This was the beginning of the Bastien piano books that have inspired so many piano students and teachers.<br><br>The Bastien piano books have been published worldwide by the Neil A. Kjos Music Company since 1963 and are now translated into 14 languages. In 1999, The Music Teachers National Association presented Jim and Jane with the Lifetime Achievement Award, the association's highest honor, in recognition of their outstanding career in music and contribution to the music profession.<br><br>James W. Bastien, loving husband and father, and a passionate piano pedagogue and musician, passed away on December 7, 2005, in La Jolla, California. During his long career, Jim became internationally known through his contributions to piano teaching, composing, writing, adjudication, and performing. With more than 300 publications to his credit, the Bastien name has become synonymous with innovative piano pedagogy.</p><h2>Losing My Virginity: How I Survived, Had Fun, and Made a Fortune Doing Business My Way</h2><p><b>The unusual, frequently outrageous autobiography of one of the great business geniuses of our time, Richard Branson.</b><br><br>In little more than twenty-five years, Richard Branson spawned nearly a hundred successful ventures. From the airline business (Virgin Atlantic Airways), to music (Virgin Records and V2), to cola (Virgin Cola), and others ranging from financial services to bridal wear, Branson has a track record second to none. Many of his companies were started in the face of entrenched competition. The experts said, "Don't do it." But Branson found golden opportunities in markets in which customers have been ripped off or underserved, where confusion reigns, and the competition is complacent. <br><br>In this stressed-out, overworked age, Richard Branson gives us a new model: a dynamic, hardworking, successful entrepreneur who lives life to the fullest. Branson has written his own "rules" for success, creating a group of companies with a global presence, but no central headquarters, no management hierarchy, and minimal bureaucracy. Family, friends, fun, and adventure are equally important as business in his life. <i>Losing My Virginity</i> is a portrait of a productive, sane, balanced life, filled with rich and colorful stories, including:<br><br> - Crash-landing his hot-air balloon in the Algerian desert, yet remaining determined to have another go at being the first to circle the globe<br><br>- Signing the Sex Pistols, Janet Jackson, the Rolling Stones, Boy George, and Phil Collins<br><br>- Fighting back when British Airways took on Virgin Atlantic and successfully suing this pillar of the British business establishment<br><br>- Swimming two miles to safety during a violent storm off the coast of Mexico<br><br>- Staging a rescue flight into Baghdad before the start of the Gulf War <br><br>And much more. <i>Losing My Virginity</i> is the ultimate tale of personal and business survival from a man who combines the business prowess of Bill Gates and the promotional instincts of P. T. Barnum.</p><p>In this autobiography, Virgin Group founder Richard Branson says one of his prime business criteria is "fun." Fun made Branson a billionaire, and few business memoirs are one-billionth as fun as Branson's, nor as niftily written. Not only does it relate his side of near-death corporate experiences, it tells how the chairman literally cheated death by gun, shipwreck, and balloon crash.<p> Branson's empire--now encompassing interests in an airline, pop music, soda pop, e-commerce, and financial services--began when the dyslexic 16-year-old dropped out of school in 1968 to found the British magazine <i>Student</i>. His headmaster said, "I predict that you will either go to prison or become a millionaire." Briefly imprisoned for dodging customs selling records, Branson got his first million by releasing <i>Tubular Bells</i>, a maverick recording all the stuffy executives rejected. (1998's <i>Tubular Bells III</i> puts the series' sales over 20 million.) </p><p> Despite wild tales of Branson's wife-swapping and Keith Richards fleeing naked from Branson's studio at gunpoint with another man's woman, the most shocking parts of the memoir concern British Airways' James Bond-like "dirty tricks" campaign against Virgin Atlantic, resulting in the biggest award for damages in English history.</p><p> Though it's filled with famous names, witty quotes, and pulse-pounding accounts of lunatic balloon adventures, it is as a business thriller that the book really scores. His instinctive bet-the-ranch tactics could cost him all, or earn another billion. Either way, Branson will likely remain the most entertaining entrepreneur in Europe. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p><b>"Oh, screw it, let's do it."</b><br><br>That's the philosophy that has allowed Richard Branson, in slightly more than twenty-five years, to spawn so many successful ventures. From the airline business (Virgin Atlantic Airways), to music (Virgin Records and V2), to cola (Virgin Cola), to retail (Virgin Megastores), and nearly a hundred others, ranging from financial services to bridal wear, Branson has a track record second to none.<br><br>Losing My Virginity is the unusual, frequently outrageous autobiography of one of the great business geniuses of our time. When Richard Branson started his first business, he and his friends decided that "since we're complete virgins at business, let's call it just that: Virgin." Since then, Branson has written his own "rules" for success, creating a group of companies with a global presence, but no central headquarters, no management hierarchy, and minimal bureaucracy.<br><br>Many of Richard Branson's companies--airlines, retailing, and cola are good examples--were started in the face of entrenched competition.

Lee has now retired from family practice but is an acknowledged expert on HRT and is a much sought-after speaker on the subject, both by health professionals and lay audiences, speaking to thousands of women at a time in seminars across the US.

Now, in Leading with the Heart, Coach K talks about leadership-how you earn it, how you practice it, and how you use it to move your organization to the top. From the importance of trust, communication, and pride, to the commitment a leader must make to his team, this inspiring book is a must-read for anyone who loves college basketball-or who simply wants to win in any competitive environment today.</p><p>In some respects, a top-level college coach is a lot like a manager in any business. He has to turn a group of talented individuals into a smoothly running team, and he has to produce results that please the fans of his team--the shareholders of the athletic program. Thus, in <i>Leading with the Heart</i>, Krzyzewski reviews the lessons he's learned as basketball coach at Duke University, and tries to universalize them so they translate to any leadership position. For example, he writes, "Adjustments are not <i>unusual</i>, they are <i>usual</i>. So a leader's ability to think on his feet ... to do things without instruction ... is of paramount importance." Makes sense, as does this admonition: "When teaching, always remember this simple phrase: 'You hear, you forget. You see, you remember. You do, you understand.'"<p> The book has four sections--"Preseason," "Regular Season," "Postseason," and "All-Season"--and each of those has four chapters. Each chapter begins with three quotes ("Too many rules get in the way of leadership" leads off chapter 1), and ends with bulleted tips summing up the chapter's message. Between the quotes and the bullet points are anecdotes about Duke basketball games and (occasionally) Krzyzewski's life outside basketball. What you come away with is an understanding of why Krzyzewski is a great basketball coach, why former Duke assistants such as Tommy Amaker and Quin Snyder are probably going to become great basketball coaches, and how anyone who's currently a coach can become a better coach. It would be great if other types of managers in other types of businesses could incorporate these lessons in compassionate, focused, highly flexible leadership, but it seems unlikely. Most managers in business rise through the ranks not because of their ability to lead or inspire but because of their knowledge and competence (if not their connections). On the other hand, it would be nice if each of us, just once, could work for someone like Coach K, someone who could push the right buttons and lead us to our own version of the Final Four. Not likely, but a pretty sweet fantasy. <i>--Lou Schuler</i></p>The program is about how Duke's legendary basketball coach treats his college players like family. He understands them and teaches them responsibility, honesty, integrity, and group responsibility. By leading with his heart, Coach K puts energy into developing his players' characters rather than the number of wins. He tells them to focus on the individual choices a player has instead of blaming others or competing with them. Above all, he understands loyalty and gratitude, and gives heartfelt praise for his parents and the teachers/coaches who supported him along the way. Though Coach K is a flat speaker, the program is anything but flat because his life is such a model of integrity and his story is told with moving eloquence.

Reprint.</p><p>Harold Schechter is a professor of American culture at Queens College (CUNY) who takes an academic interest in the history of violent folklore: "Our pop entertainments aren't necessarily more brutal than those of the past," he writes. "They are simply ... more state of the art." In this book Schechter turns his keen historian's gaze on real-life serial killer Albert Fish, who killed--and ate--as many as 15 children in New York City in the 20s. Fish resembled a meek, kindly, white-haired grandfather, but was actually an intense sadomasochist whose sexual fetishes included almost everything known to psychiatry. For example, he stuck 29 needles into his pelvic region. Apparently Schechter, while writing his book <i>Deviant</i> about Ed Gein, asked Robert Bloch (author of <i>Psycho</i>), "Why are people so fascinated by Ed Gein?" Bloch answered, "Because they haven't heard about Albert Fish." <br> Also recommended: <i>Depraved</i>, Schechter's book about Herman Mudgett a.k.a. Dr. H. H. Holmes.In May, 1928, a kindly old man came to the door of the Budd family home in New York City. A few days later, he persuaded Mr. and Mrs. Budd to let him take their adorable little girl, Grace, on an outing. Albert Fish appeared to be a harmless, white-haired grandfather.

Born in 1979 in Norwich, England, he always wanted to be a writer. After experimenting in the service and retail trades for a few years, Smith decided to go to University. He studied English and American Literature at the University of East Anglia, and it was here that he first explored his love of publishing. Along with poet Luke Wright, he founded Egg Box Publishing, a groundbreaking magazine and press that promotes talented new authors. He also started writing literally hundreds of articles, short stories and books ranging from <i>Scooby Doo</i> comic strips to world atlases, <i>Midsomer Murders</i> to <i>X-Files</i>. The research for these projects led to countless book ideas germinating in his head. His first book, <i>The Inventors</i>, written with his nine-year-old brother Jamie, was published in the U.K. in 2007.

I couldn&#x2019;t even see where I was going anymore, my vision fading as my body prepared to give in. If the siren hadn&#x2019;t been hammering at my eardrums, then I&#x2019;d have been able to hear my breaths, ragged and desperate, unable to pull in enough air to keep me going.</p><p>Just one more flight of stairs, one more and I might make it.</p><p>I forced myself to run faster, the metal staircase rattling</p><p>beneath my clumsy steps. Everywhere around me other kids were panicking, all bolting the same way, to safety. I didn&#x2019;t look back to see what was behind us. I didn&#x2019;t need to. I could picture it in my head, its demonic muzzle, silver eyes, and those teeth&#x2014;like razor wire.</p><p>Someone grabbed my arm, pulling me back. I lost my balance, spilling over the railing. For a second the yard appeared five stories beneath me and I almost let myself go. Better this way than to be devoured, right? Then the beast shrieked through its wet throat and I started running again before I even knew I was doing it. I heard the rattle of the cell doors, knew they were closing. If I was caught out here, then I was history. I leaped up the last few steps, hurtling down the narrow landing. The inmates jeered from their cells, shouting for me to die. They stuck out their arms and legs to trip me, and it almost worked. I staggered, lurched forward, falling.</p><p>Somehow I made it, swinging through the door an instant before it slammed shut, the mechanism locking tight. The creature howled, a banshee&#x2019;s wail that made my skin crawl. I risked looking back through the bars, saw its huge bulk bounding past my cell, no skin to hide its grotesque muscles. There was a scream as it found another victim, but it didn&#x2019;t matter. I was safe. </p><p>For now.</p><p>&#x201c;That was close,&#x201d; said a voice behind me. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re getting good at this.&#x201d;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t answer, just stared out across the prison. Six stories of cells beneath me and God only knew how many more above my head, all buried deep underground. I felt like the weight of the world was pressing down on me, like I&#x2019;d been buried alive, and the panic began to set in. I closed my eyes, sucking in as much of the hot, stale air as I could, trying to picture the outside world, the sun, the ocean, my family.</p><p>All things I would never see again.</p><p>&#x201c;Yup,&#x201d; came the voice, my cellmate. &#x201c;Bet it&#x2019;s starting to feel like home already.&#x201d;</p><p>I opened my eyes and the prison was still there. Furnace Penitentiary. The place they send you to forget about you, to punish you for your crimes, even when you didn&#x2019;t commit them. Only one way in and no way out. Yeah, this was my home now, it would be until I died.</p><p>That wouldn&#x2019;t be long. Not with the gangs that eyeballed me from behind their bars. Not with the blacksuits, the guards who ran their shotguns along the railings as they checked the cells. Not with those creatures, raw fury in their eyes and blood on their breath.</p><p>And there were worse things in Furnace, much worse. Maybe tonight the blood watch would come, drag me from my cell. Maybe tonight they&#x2019;d turn me into a monster.</p><p>I dropped to my knees, cradling my head in my hands. There had to be a way out of here, a way to escape. I tried to find one in the hurricane of my thoughts, tried to come up with a plan. But all I could think about was how I came to be here, how I went from being a normal kid to an inmate in the worst hellhole on Earth.</p><p>How I ended up in Furnace.</p></p><h2>The SIBO Diet Plan: Four Weeks to Relieve Symptoms and Manage SIBO</h2><p><p><strong>Relief from SIBO is here&#x2015;a 4 week diet plan for managing symptoms.</strong></p><p>The key to SIBO symptom relief is a commitment to a SIBO-friendly diet.

One such law states that for every action there is a reaction, and that for every motion there is corresponding counter-motion. Whether it s visible to the human eye or not, one thing is certain movement and change will occur as a result. Having studied these principles, author Raymond Holliwell not only understood the universal physical applications, he also understood the spiritual and mental applications as well. <br><br>By using this law on a spiritual and mental level, Holliwell found that a specific thought could create a desired reaction in his personal and professional life through continual and dedicated practice. As he came to realize the expanded potential of this powerful law, he eventually recognized the ultimate source of the dramatic results God.<br><br>There are countless laws that impact on our daily lives and actions. But there are other laws just waiting to be discovered and put to work from within laws that anyone can use to live a limitless and prosperous life. After many printings, the lessons in WORKING WITH THE LAW are still being taught in numerous workshops around the country and continue to provide the reader with a new opportunity to take action and re-think their strategy for success by simply working with the law.<br><br>FROM THE INTRODUCTION: If life can move along effortlessly and orderly some of the time, why does it not do so always? When we ponder this question, often in the midst of discouragement and difficulty, we feel that something is eluding us. What is that something? According to the author of Working with the Law, Dr. Raymond Holliwell, that something is God or as he prefers to name it, Law. He states in his preface: "I shall call God working in our lives Law. Interpreting the Law in several ways should bring it more clearly into our way of thinking. Then as we strive to work with the Law we are living closer to God, and such living brings a better understanding."</p><p>Dr. Raymond Holliwell (1900-1986) had a highly logical mind and was an inspired teacher who employed a clear, specific approach to this subject. For these reasons, Working with the Law is an excellent resource for group study.

"It ain't over till it's over."&#x2014;that&#x2019;s Yogi's answer to a reporter when he was managing the Mets in July 1973, and they were nine games out of first place (not only quotable, but prophetic&#x2014;they won the pennant). "Nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded."&#x2014;Yogi's comment to Stan Musial and Joe Garagiola about Ruggeri's restaurant in St. Louis in 1959. "It gets late early out there."&#x2014;Yogi describing how shadows crept across Yankee Stadium's left field during late autumn afternoons.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>If the subtitle of this delicious collection of Yogi-isms has you scratching your head, it has done its job as stunningly as Berra used to do his behind the plate at Yankee Stadium. The Hall of Fame MVP catcher for the pinstriped dynasties of the late 1940s through the '50s and into the '60s, Berra was about as quick with his witticisms as he was with his bat and glove. But if his observations hit the heart of the plate, his grammar tended to pop out of left field, hence the creation of a unique mode of malapropism dubbed the Yogi-ism. To truly understand the title, you need to know that not every mot ascribed to Yogi actually emanated from his mouth--they only sounded like they should have. Thus, he really <i>didn't</i> say everything he said, which makes <i>The Yogi Book</i> absolutely necessary (see page 10). <p> To the things that Yogi did say, <i>The Yogi Book</i> does both service and justice. It gathers the witticisms in a single convenient volume, adds a scrapbook of photos, then lets their progenitor riff, filling in color commentary on what was happening beyond his mind and what was going through it when the famous phrases were dispatched into the public domain. He deservedly takes credit for such immortal pronunciamentos as "Nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded." (page 16); "It's deja vu all over again." (page 30); "When you come to a fork in the road, take it." (page 48); "The future ain't what it used to be." (page 118); "It gets late early out there." (page 64); and "Ninety percent of this game is half mental." (page 69). All, like the sacred texts they happen to be, are appropriately parsed for your edification, as is the greatest Yogi-ism of them all: "It ain't over 'til it's over." (page 121).</p>Hardly anyone would quarrel...that Winston Churchill has been replaced by Yogi Berra as the...favorite source of quotations. (The New Yorker)<p> "Yogi Berra was one of the first guys to allow himself to be kidded by his teammates. A shrewd move--they made him one of the most famous personalities in America." (Tim Mccarver)</p><p> "Yogi's son Larry and I played on the Montclair High School Basketball team together. At the time, Yogi represented Yoo-Hoo soft drinks. When we'd win, Yogi would bring the Yoo-Hoo to</p><p> the locker room. When we'd lose, we got nothing. Prior to the games, Yogi would tell us, "If you win, you get the Yoo-Hoo, if you lose you get the Boo-Hoo!" (Leonard S. Coleman Jr.)</p><p> "Yogi came back to my dressing room after our show at the Garden State Arts Center in New Jersey. He has always been one of my heroes. I felt like I was in the locker room after hitting a home run and winning the World Series. Yogi looked at me and said, "Wow, kid, I wouldn't want to do what you do...the work's too hard!" ( "Talking to Yogi Berra about baseball is like talking to Homer about the gods." (Bart</p><p> Giamatti)</p><p> "When I was on Saturday Night Live, Yogi played himself in a mock documentary called 'Ballplayers.' Christopher Guest and I played 75-year-old black ballplayers talking about the old days. We acted our hearts out. Yogi had one line and stole the movie. I'll never work with him again!" (Billy Crystal)</p><p> "A conversation with Yogi Berra is as memorable as seeing a game in Yankee Stadium in its heyday." (Frank Sinatra)</p><p> "I was standing at home plate and the announcer said, 'Now catching for the Yankees, Yogi Berra.' I'd never heard of him and there he was--his shin guards and chest protector were too long--and I thought, 'Who are they trying to kid with this guy?' Well, I played against him for ten years and I appreciated his abilities more and more and more. He made the pitchers pitch. And he was a damn good hitter!" (Ted Williams)</p><p> "I make a lot of speeches. Often, to illustrate a point, I reach back for a Yogi expression because Yogi can sum up a situation like nobody else. Thanks, Yogi." (Brendan T. Byrne)</p><p> "Yogi Berra is a national treasure. I've been using his remarks to close all my speeches and they always bring huge laughs. I love Yogi--always have, always will."

With Berezovsky serving as the younger entrepreneur&#x2019;s <i>krysha</i>&#x2014;literally, his roof, his protector&#x2014;they battled their way through the &#x201c;Wild East&#x201d; of Russia until their relationship soured when Berezovsky attacked President Vladimir Putin in the media. Dead bodies trailed Berezovsky as he escaped to London, where an associate died painfully of Polonium poisoning, creating an international furor. As Abramovich prospered, Berezovsky was found dead in a luxurious London town house, declared a suicide.<br> <br> With unprecedented, exclusive first-person sourcing, Mezrich takes us inside a world of unimaginable wealth, power, and corruption to uncover this exciting story, a true-life thriller epic for our time&#x2014;&#x201c;<i>Wolf Hall</i> on the Moskva&#x201d; (<i>Bookpage</i>).</p><p>Ben Mezrich graduated magna cum laude from Harvard. He has published seventeen books, including the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestsellers <i>The Accidental Billionaires</i>, which was adapted into the Academy Award&#x2013;winning film<i>&nbsp;The Social Network</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Bringing Down the House</i>, which was the basis for the hit movie&nbsp;<i>21.&nbsp;</i>He lives in Boston.Once Upon a Time in Russia CHAPTER ONE<p></p> <br>July 2000,<br> <br>Kuntsevo Dacha, Fili District<br> <br>THE SILENCE WAS EXCRUCIATING, the minutes ticking by thick and heavy, time itself gorging on the tension in the humid air. Even though the shades had been drawn back from the trio of windows pocking the long plaster walls of the cavernous dining room, it was impossible to tell how deep into the afternoon the day had drifted; the dense forest that surrounded the isolated, two-story compound cast deep shadows across the reinforced glass panes, shifting whatever remained of the bright summer light toward an ominous, gunmetal gray.<br> <br>For the eighteen middle-aged men in dark suits shifting uncomfortably in their seats as they waited in that palpable silence around an oversize dining room table, it was hard to believe that they were still technically within Moscow&#x2019;s city limits. Though, to be fair, this aging, stone house tucked in the middle of the dark woods, surrounded by a pair of chain-link fences topped by barbed wire, was a symbol of a much different Moscow than the rapidly growing metropolis beyond the wire. The men in this room had traveled back in time more than fifty years the minute they had been ushered out of their chauffeured limousines&#x2014;now parked in glistening rows behind the double fences&#x2014;and led through the dacha&#x2019;s front door.<br> <br>The setting of the meeting was not lost on any of the men. The invitation that had been delivered by official courier to each of them in the preceding weeks had been met by everything from incredulous laughter to expressions of suspicion. Every soul knew what this place was: whose house this had once been, and what had supposedly taken place here. None of the men looked carefully into the shadows that played across the aging walls, darkening the corners of the vast, high-ceilinged room.<br> <br>Even though this house had fallen into disuse a generation ago&#x2014;and was now more museum than functioning dacha&#x2014;the meeting&#x2019;s address had meaning far beyond the invitation itself. And the longer the men were forced to wait for whatever was going to happen next, the more ominous the setting seemed.<br> <br>Under the best of circumstances, these men were not accustomed to waiting. To describe them as powerful businessmen&#x2014;or even billionaires&#x2014;would have been a laughable understatement. Among them, they represented the largest&#x2014;and fastest&#x2014;accumulation of wealth in modern history. Within the Russian media, they had garnered the label Oligarchs&#x2014;a term that was usually derogatory, defining them as a class apart and above. According to the popular notion, over the course of the past decade, as the former Soviet nation had lurched into capitalism through a complex, often shadowy process of privatization, this class&#x2014;the Oligarchs&#x2014;had accumulated insane riches, and they had used this wealth to imbed and twist themselves, like strangling vines, into the ruling mechanisms of the nation&#x2019;s government, economy, and culture.<br> <br>Most of the men in this room would have bristled at the designation. If anything, they saw themselves as representatives of the new, free, and modern Russia. Almost all of them had come from poverty; many had clawed their way out of childhoods filled with deprivation and prejudice. Many at one point had been mathematicians, scientists, or academics before they had turned their ambitions to business. If they had succeeded&#x2014;and yes, as a group they had succeeded to a degree perhaps unique in history&#x2014;it was despite the chronic corruption and cronyism of the shifting Russian paradigm, not because of it.<br> <br>Oligarchs or not, men who earned billions were not known for their patience. Eventually, the silence got the better of the room, and one of the invitees, seated closest to the door that led back into the interior of the house, cleared his throat.<br> <br>&#x201c;If some Chechen managed to get a bomb in here and blew us all to hell,&#x201d; he asked, &#x201c;do you think anyone would mourn?&#x201d;<br> <br>Awkward laughter riffed through the room, then trickled away into the shadows. The macabre joke may have hit too close to home. Whatever the men thought about themselves, it wasn&#x2019;t exactly the best time to be a billionaire in Russia. Worse yet, the idea of a bomb going off in the dining room of such an ominous address wasn&#x2019;t as far-fetched as they would have liked to believe.<br> <br>Before anyone could break the silence again, there was a rush of motion&#x2014;a door opening on the far side of the dining room. The air seemed to tighten still further, like a leather strap suddenly pulled taut. After a brief pause, a lone man entered through the doorway. Head down, every step and movement controlled and determined, from his forceful, athletic gait to the way his lean, muscled arms shifted stiffly at his sides. Short of stature&#x2014;five foot seven at the most&#x2014;with thinning hair, pinpoint eyes, a narrow, almost daggered jaw&#x2014;his presence was somehow well beyond the amalgamation of his parts. As he strolled in, warmly shaking each man&#x2019;s hand in turn, none of the billionaires at the table could have turned away even if they had dared. He didn&#x2019;t just project an imposing aura: he was a mystery, an unknown, and these gathered businessmen had built their lives&#x2014;and fortunes&#x2014;on their abilities to procure and use knowledge. Even though some of them had been responsible for their host&#x2019;s ascension to power&#x2014;had in fact hand-picked him for the role he now played&#x2014;they had done so without knowing much about him. In truth, that had been one of his main selling points. He was purposefully obscure, a supposed nobody&#x2014;a loyal cog. They had thought that a man like that would be easy to control.<br> <br>There was nothing easy about him as he took position at the front of the room, facing the table.<br> <br>And then he smiled.<br> <br>&#x201c;????? ??????????.&#x201d;<br> <br>A warm welcome, my colleagues.<br> <br>He looked around the room, matching each of the gathered billionaire&#x2019;s eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;Some of you supported me,&#x201d; he continued, his voice low and steady, as he paused on a few of the staring faces.<br> <br>&#x201c;Some of you did not.&#x201d;<br> <br>Again, he lingered on a handful more.<br> <br>&#x201c;But none of that matters now. You have done very well for yourselves. You have built vast fortunes.&#x201d;<br> <br>He waited, the room as silent and still as a pane of glass.<br> <br>&#x201c;You can keep what you have. Business is important. Industry is important. But from here on out, you are simply businessmen&#x2014;and only businessmen.&#x201d;<br> <br>Before any of the men could react, there was another flash of motion&#x2014;and then a group of lower-ranking officials took over, ushering a team of butlers into the room, each carrying a tray laden with porcelain and gold tea settings. Collective relief moved around the table; at the same time, it dawned on most of the men in the room that they had made an immense miscalculation. This loyal nobody, this obscure cog had become something else. Every moment of the meeting had been choreographed, from the very moment he had invited them here, to this place, imbued with so much brutal meaning.<br> <br>Just a few yards down, off the hall now bustling with servers carrying tea into the dining room, were the study and living quarters where Joseph Stalin had spent his final two decades. This house&#x2014;Stalin&#x2019;s Moscow home&#x2014;had been the symbolic headquarters of the most infamous, powerful, and brutal regime in their nation&#x2019;s history.<br> <br>And Vladimir Putin&#x2014;the man at the front of the room now trading niceties with the nearest of his guests, while butlers served tea up and down the dining room table&#x2014;had just sent them a clear, explicit message.<br> <br>Putin was not a simple cog they could twist and turn as they wanted.<br> <br>The Oligarchs had been warned:<br> <br>You can keep your billions.<br> <br>But stay out of my way . . .</p><h2>Re:ZERO, Vol. 2 - light novel (Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-, 2)</h2><p>Breaking free of his death loop in the royal city, Subaru awakes in an opulent mansion, being tended to by the twin maids Ram and Rem.

By turning to drugs and alcohol, people who have suffered a loss can numb their grief. In the process, they postpone their healing and can drive themselves further into addiction.</p> <p><em>The Mindfulness Workbook for Addiction</em> offers readers an effective program for working through their addiction and grief with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). Created by a psychologist who works for the Department of Veterans Affairs and a marriage and family therapist who works for Sharp Mesa Vista Hospital, this mindfulness training workbook is effective for treating the emotion dysregulation, stress, depression, and grief that lie at the heart of addiction. No matter the loss, the mindfulness skills in this workbook help readers process their grief, determine the function their addiction is serving, and replace the addiction with healthy coping behaviors.</p></p><p><b>Rebecca E.

The Rainbow Crow brings fire on a burning stick from the Great Spirit in the sky to the snow-covered woodland animals. Because of the smoke he inhales as he flies back to the woodlands, he unselfishly loses his beautiful voice. No longer is he a rainbow-colored bird, but a black crow. His crackly "caw" and plain black feathers give him his freedom, however, for man, who has not yet arrived in the woodlands, will not hunt crow. Because Crow cannot sing, his feathers are black, and his meat tastes like fire and smoke, he will be free. Thus is his unselfishness rewarded. The illustrations, done in a primitive style, create a true sense of the Pennsylvania Lenape Indians and their winters.

It wasn&#39;t because the last time he&#39;d seen her, he had been fleeing for his life from a strange island. Nor was it because of the little girl she had in tow, claiming Animal was the father. It was because women like Red Sonja carried trouble around with them like designer purses. He knew getting involved with Sonja again would come at a price, but he had no idea how steep the price would be until it was too late. With his wife gone and his children abducted by a ruthless drug cartel, Animal must lead a suicide mission into the lair of one of the most dangerous assassins in the world, a woman who calls herself Tiger Lily. To go against Tiger Lily and the cartel Animal would need an army, so the call to arms is put out and the streets readily answer. Leading a handful of loyal souls against seemingly insurmountable odds, Animal races against the clock to save his children and put a stop to Tiger Lily and the cartel&#39;s plans, while trying to stay one step ahead of the two detectives following the trail of bodies. Things take an unexpected turn when Animal learns a dark truth hidden beneath what he had been led to believe that changes everything, including who can be trusted. When the Grand Design his father had always spoken of is finally revealed Animal will be forced to make the hard choice between love, loyalty, and vengeance.</p><p>K'wan is a multiple literary award winner and bestselling author of over a twenty titles which include: Gangsta, Road Dawgz, Street Dreams, Hoodlum, Eve, Hood Rat, Blow, Still Hood, Gutter, Section 8, From Harlem with Love, The Leak, Welfare Wifeys, Eviction Notice, Love &amp; Gunplay, Animal, The Life &amp; Times of Slim Goodie, Purple Reign, Little Nikki Grind, Animal II, The Fix, Black Lotus, First &amp; Fifteenth, Ghetto Bastard, Animal 3, The Fix 2, The Fix 3 and Animal 4.

Soon Jack is chasing them to a land beyond the clouds, with his little sister, Annabella, in tow. The kingdom of giants is full of super-sized fun: puddings to swim in, spoons to use as catapults, monster toads to carry off pesky little sisters. . . . <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Jack and Annabella are on a mission. The king of the giants has taken something that belongs to them, and they&#x2019;ll do anything&#x2014;even dive into a smelly tureen of green bean soup&#x2014;to get it back.<br><br><b>&#x201c;Liesl Shurtliff has the uncanny ability to make magical worlds feel utterly real, and the best part is: you don&#x2019;t even need a beanstalk to visit them</b>.&#x201d; &#x2014;Tim Federle, author of <i>Better Nate than Ever<br></i><br><b>"A delightful story of family, perseverance, and courage.</b>" <i>&#x2014;Booklist</i></p><p><b>Liesl Shurtliff </b>was born and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah. Just like Jack, she was made to do lots of yard work, pulling weeds and growing green stuff she did not want to eat. These days, she dearly loves her local farmers&#x2019; market and always makes her kids eat the green stuff.<br> Before she became a writer, Liesl graduated from Brigham Young University with a degree in music, dance, and theater. Her first three books,&nbsp;<i>Rump, Jack</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Red</i>&nbsp;are all&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestsellers and&nbsp;<i>Rump&nbsp;</i>was named to over two dozen state award lists and won an ILA Children&#x2019;s Book Award.&nbsp;She lives in Chicago with her family, where she continues to spin fairy tales.<br><br>Visit her at lieslshurtliff.comWhen I was born, Papa named me after my great-great-great-great-great-great-GREAT-grandfather, who, legend had it, conquered nine giants and married the daughter of a duke. Mama said this was all hogwash. Firstly, there was no such thing as giants. Wouldn&#x2019;t we see such large creatures if they really existed? And secondly, we had no relation to any duke--if we did, we&#x2019;d be rich and living on a grand estate. Instead, we were poor as dirt and lived in a tiny house on a small farm in a little village. Nothing great or giant about it.<br><br> But Papa wasn&#x2019;t concerned with the details. He believed there was greatness in that name, and if he gave it to me, somehow the greatness would sink into my bones.<br><br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll name him Jack,&#x201d; Papa said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll be great.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;If you say so,&#x201d; said Mama. She was a practical woman and not particular with names. All she needed was a word to call me to supper, or deliver a scolding. I got my first scolding before my first supper, just after birth, for as soon as Papa pronounced my name, I sprang a sharp tooth, and bit my mother.<br><br> &#x201c;Ouch!&#x201d; Mama cried. &#x201c;You naughty boy!&#x201d; It was something she would call me more often than Jack.<br><br> Papa had the nerve to laugh. &#x201c;Oh, Alice, he&#x2019;s just a baby. He doesn&#x2019;t know any better.&#x201d;<br><br> But Mama believed I did know better. To her, that bite was a little omen of what was to come, like a sprinkle before the downpour, a buzz before the sting, or the onset of an itch before you realize you&#x2019;re covered in poison ivy.<br><br> Maybe I was born to be great, but great at what?<br><br> At five months old, I learned to crawl. I was fast as a cockroach, Papa said. One minute I was by Mama&#x2019;s skirts, and the next I was in the pigsty, rolling around in the muck and slops. Mama said she had to bathe me twice a day just to keep me from turning into a real pig.<br><br> I learned to walk before my first year, and by my second I took to climbing. I climbed chairs and tables, the woodpile, trees. Once Mama found me on the roof, and snatched me up before I slid down the chimney into a blazing fire.<br><br> &#x201c;Such a naughty boy,&#x201d; said Mama.<br><br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s just a boy,&#x201d; said Papa.<br><br> But I didn&#x2019;t want to be &#x201c;just a boy.&#x201d; I wanted to be great.&nbsp;<br><br> At night, Papa would tell stories of Grandpa Jack: how he&#x2019;d chop off giants&#x2019; heads and steal all their treasure and rescue the innocents. I knew if I was going to be great, I&#x2019;d have to go on a noble quest and conquer a giant--or nine--just like my seven-greats-grandpa Jack.&nbsp;<br><br> There was only one problem. I&#x2019;d never seen a giant in all my twelve years.&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Stop staring at the sky, Jack,&#x201d; said Papa. &#x201c;The work&#x2019;s down here.&#x201d;<br><br> It was harvesttime, same as every year. Work, work, work. Boring, boring, boring. And after the work was done, we were still poor as dirt.<br><br> Papa whistled a merry tune as he cut the wheat. I grumbled as I gathered it up in a bundle and tied it around the middle. We did this over and over, until we&#x2019;d made a pile as tall as Papa. I thought we&#x2019;d be nearly done, but when I looked up, I saw acres of uncut wheat. &#x201c;Snakes and toads.&#x201d; I grumbled. How I hated the sight.<br><br> &#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t she the prettiest sight you ever saw?&#x201d; Papa called the land she, like a lady he was trying to woo. Most of the time it seemed like the land just spat in Papa&#x2019;s face, but he was ever faithful. Papa loved the land.<br><br> Me? I could live without it. I preferred a sword to a scythe, and a noble steed to a cow. I&#x2019;d go on a quest to fight giants and get gold and riches. Then I&#x2019;d never have to milk another cow or harvest a crop on a hot day.<br><br> I looked toward the house, where Mama was hanging the wash on the line. Annabella was flitting around her like a butterfly, her braids bouncing on her shoulders, not a care in the world, until . . .<br><br> &#x201c;Eeeeaak!&#x201d; Annabella screamed, and frantically shook her apron. A fat grasshopper flew out and disappeared into the tall grass.<br><br> I stifled a laugh. Annabella is my sister, four years younger. I guess when I hit three or so, Mama decided I was a lost cause and tried again, taking every precaution to do things differently. So firstly, she had a girl, and secondly, she didn&#x2019;t allow Papa to name her or make any declarations of greatness. She was Mama&#x2019;s sweet girl.<br><br> I remember seeing Annabella for the first time after she was born, all pink and bald and toothless. Mama cooed at her like she&#x2019;d finally gotten what she always wanted. A boring lump that didn&#x2019;t bite or even move.<br><br> &#x201c;Back to work, Jack,&#x201d; said Papa.<br><br> I sighed. Papa cut and I gathered and tied. Work, work, work. Boring, boring, boring. I considered feigning illness so I could take a break.<br><br> But what luck! Someone else disrupted the work for me. Mama was walking toward us now. Annabella bounced at her side, and on the other side was our nearest neighbor, but certainly not our dearest friend, Miss Lettie Nettle.<br><br> She looked none too pleased at this moment. Her eyebrows were pushed together, and the folds around her mouth hung down around her chin like one of those sad-faced hounds, only she was an angry hound. She glared right at me. Mama anxiously twisted her apron in her hands.<br><br> I scratched my head and scoured my brain. Had I pulled any pranks on Miss Lettie lately? I didn&#x2019;t think so. . . .</p><h2>When Sadness is at Your Door</h2><p><b>A comforting primer in emotional literacy and mindfulness that suggests we approach the feeling of sadness as if it is our guest.</b><br><br>Sadness can be scary and confusing at any age! When we feel sad, especially for long periods of time, it can seem as if the sadness is a part of who we are--an overwhelming, invisible, and scary sensation.<br><br>In <i>When Sadness Is at Your Door</i>, Eva Eland brilliantly approaches this feeling as if it is a visitor. She gives it a shape and a face, and encourages the reader to give it a name, all of which helps to demystify it and distinguish it from ourselves. She suggests activities to do with it, like sitting quietly, drawing, and going outside for a walk. The beauty of this approach is in the respect the book has for the feeling, and the absence of a narrative that encourages the reader to "get over" it or indicates that it's "bad," both of which are anxiety-producing notions.<br><br>Simple illustrations that recall the classic style of Crockett Johnson (<i>Harold and the Purple Crayon</i>) invite readers to add their own impressions.<br><br>Eva Eland's debut picture book is a great primer in mindfulness and emotional literacy, perfect for kids navigating these new feelings--and for adult readers tackling the feelings themselves!</p><p>EVA ELAND Eva Eland is a Dutch author and illustrator who lives in the UK. She earned an MA with distinction in children's book illustration from the prestigious Cambridge School of Art, and has also studied at the Gerrit Rietveld Academy and the School of Visual Arts in New York.

"It follows you around...and sits so close to you, you can hardly breathe." The narrator advises the host&#x2014;a small child&#x2014;not to hide his sadness or be afraid. "Listen to it. Ask where it comes from and what it needs. If you don't understand each other, just sit together and be quiet for a while." Then, try doing something comforting together like drawing, listening to music, or drinking cocoa. And, just as it came, unexpectedly, one day it will be gone. By focusing on the feeling, rather than the circumstance, the book speaks to readers of all ages and backgrounds. The portrayal of the feeling as so much larger than the boy helps convey the overwhelming nature of the emotion. The front endpapers show people of different ages in sad, thoughtful poses with the green creature interspersed&#x2014;laying down, crying, staring at the ground, etc. The back endpapers show "sadness" doing yoga, petting a cat, taking a bath, eating an ice cream, getting a hug...finding comfort where it can. The handwritten text and illustrative sketches are rendered in brown on cream paper with pale red and green accents. VERDICT This quiet book is both constructive and reassuring and recommended for any collection with a bibliotherapy section.&#x2014;Barbara Auerbach, Cairo Public Library, NY</p><h2>Saxon Math 8/7 with Prealgebra (Kit: Text, Test/Worksheets, Solutions Manual)</h2><p>Saxon Math 8/7 is made up of five instructional components: Warm up Activities including Facts Practice, Mental Math, and Problem Solving; Daily Lesson; Lesson Practice; Cumulative Practice; and Cumulative Tests.

A fly changes some minds in this diminutive tale&#x2014;first, by astounding the lad who captures him in a jar ("BUZZ!" "You know my name! You are the smartest pet in the world!"), then, thanks to some fancy flying, by convincing the lad's parents and ultimately even the judges of the Amazing Pet Show that he's more than just a nuisance. A pop-eyed, self-confident mite in Arnold's droll cartoon illustrations, Fly Guy's up to any challenge, whether it be eating a hot dog (well, most of it, anyway), or performing amazing aerial acrobatics; readers drawn by the flashy foil cover will stick around to applaud this unusually capable critter. Any similarity to Ezra Jack Keats's Pet Show! (1972) is surely coincidental. (Picture book. 6-8) <br><br>Kirkus<br>Hi! Fly Guy<br>Tedd Arnold. Scholastic/Cartwheel, $5.99 (32p) ISBN 0-439-63903-4<br>A fly went flying," opens Arnold's (Parts) brief, playful tale, structured in three chapters. At the same time, "A boy went walking." The winged fellow is looking for food and the boy is searching for a critter for the upcoming Amazing Pet Show. The two equally and comically bug-eyed beings meet when the fly collides with the human hero's nose ("boink") and the lad captures it in a glass jar. After the infuriated insect stomps his foot and says, "Buzz!" the amazed boy replies, "You know my name! You are the smartest pet in the world!" Buzz shows his new pet, which he names Fly Guy, to his parents; his father announces that flies are pests and grabs a swatter&#x2014;until the sly fly lands on Buzz's nose and calls him by name. In one of the book's funniest pictures, Fly Guy is dwarfed by the hot dog Buzz places in his jar, most of which he happily consumes. Though the pet show judges tell Buzz that flies don't qualify as pets, Fly Guy rises to the occasion and wows the judges with various feats, clinching the prize for smartest pet. Suitably wacky cartoon art accompanies the text, which is simple enough for beginning readers ready to soar to a chapter-book format. Ages 4-8. (Sept.)<br>BCCB<br>A fly out flying encounters a boy out looking for a pet, and it's a match made in early-reader heaven<br>. The fly apparently knows the boy's name-Buzz-which endears the insect to his new master (and his<br> skeptical parents). Buzz takes Fly Guy, as he's named his new pet, to the Amazing Pet Show, where<br> clever Fly Guy wins over doubting judges with his ability to say his master's name and perform tricks<br>. The story ends pretty abruptly, but this is aimed squarely at an audience with only slightly more<br> reading stamina than the common housefly anyway; the controlled vocabulary (with a few more<br> challenging words thrown in) and frequent repetition add to the ease of access. The look is edgy<br>, especially the cover's motion-effect iridescent graphics, with the interior art sporting Arnold's<br> trademark bulbous-eyed caricatures textured with hairy squiggles; Buzz, who has the stocky solidity of <br>a trash can, is actually rather more taciturn than the hyper-expressive Fly Guy, whose antics steal the <br>show. Novice readers, particularly those unmoved by cuddlier stories, will welcome the doriy wit of <br>this oddball-pet saga. DS<br><br>SLJ ARNOLD, Tedd. Hi! Fly Guy! illus. by author. 30p. CIP.

Initially he was with the Methodist church but their stance against healing forced him elsewhere. During the depression and World War II he travelled as an independent evangelist. In 1946, he published a brief book entitled "Atomic Power with God through Prayer and Fasting." The book, which provided detailed information on the methods and benefits of fasting, was an immediate success and brought Hall considerable fame. According to Hall, all of the major evangelists began following his fasting regime and miracles erupted everywhere. Many observers of the early revival years agreed, as one said, "Every one of these men down through the years followed Franklin Hall's method of fasting."&nbsp; &#x201c;Gloried Fasting&#x201d; further explores the significance of fasting for Christians and provides vivid testimonials from those transformed by their experiences with fasting.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><p></p><h2>Fasting: Opening the Door to a Deeper, More Intimate, More Powerful Relationship With God</h2><p><b>NEW YORK TIMES BEST SELLER!<br> Author of several books, including <i>Believe That You Can</i>, <i>Fear Fighters</i>, and <i>The Spirit of Python</i></b><br><br> In this<b><i>New York Times</i> Best-Seller</b> and one of the best available books on the topic, Jentezen Franklin explains the spiritual power of fasting and offers a deeper understanding of God&#x2019;s plan for fasting and the benefits available to those who participate.

Manipulating. <br><br>Will they ever change? <br> <br>What will it take to get through to them? <br> <br>They apologized, but will this time be different...or will they just get better at hiding what they are up to? <br><br>This book will help you get out of the fog of confusion and into the clarity that you are looking for. <br><br>FOG is an acronym that stands for "Fear, Obligation, and Guilt." These three emotions are often at the core of manipulation, and are often how narcissists, sociopaths, and other types of emotional manipulators go about controlling their targets. <br><br>However, this type of destructive manipulation isn't just limited to narcissists and sociopaths. <br><br>There is no shortage of people with well-intended bad advice out there who unintentionally fall into the FOG as well, and push targets of abuse into keeping the relationship going. <br><br>The FOG is one of the main reasons that people stay "stuck" in abusive relationships for so long, why they continue to get involved with abusive people, why they feel that they are the problem, and why they tend to feel that the abuse is somehow their fault. <br><br>When a person is being manipulated they have a hard time figuring out who has the problem, what is normal, what is problematic, and if their wants, needs, and feelings are valid. The disasterous effects of being lost in the FOG are confusion, crazymaking, people pleasing, and an erosion of boundaries. <br><br>What makes this well-intended bad advice so damaging is that, on the surface, it seems like good advice--especially if it's coming from people who seem to have our best interests in mind, such as friends, family, church members, support group members, or a therapist. <br><br>Some examples of this well-intended bad advice that comes from other people is: <br><br>"Who are you to judge?""No one is perfect.""You need to forgive them.""She's your mother, you need to have a relationship with her...she's not getting any younger you know.""Commitment is forever." <br><br>What can be so crazymaking for targets is that they are often getting two very different messages. On one hand, they are told that they need to work towards a solution, and on the other, they are told that need to leave a partner who lies, cheats, steals, hits, yells, or belittles them. <br><br>This book compares and contrasts of these concepts so that targets of any type of manipulation and abuse can make a more empowered decision. <br><br>Some of the concepts covered are: <br><br>Who are You to Judge vs. Being Discerning<br>No One is Perfect vs. Tolerating Abuse<br>You Need to Forgive Them vs. Keeping Yourself Safe<br>A Parent vs. A Predator<br>Commitment vs. Codependency<br>Self-love vs. Selfishness<br>A Person Acting the Part vs. A Person Actually Changing<br>Gut Instincts vs. Hypervigilance<br>A Friend vs. Someone Being Friendly<br>Caring vs. Caretaking<br>Being in Love With Them vs. Being in Love With Who They Pretended to Be<br>Workable Behavior vs. Deal Breakers<br>Acceptance vs. Allowance<br>Going Through So Much Together vs. Being Put Through So Much By Them<br>Sincerity vs. Intensity<br>Healthy Bonding vs. Trauma Bonding<br>Insincere Remorse vs. Sincere Remorse<br>Reacting vs. Responding<br> <br>...and many more.</p><p><p>I wish I had this information 47 years ago! - A.

After the Reys escaped Paris by bicycle in 1940 carrying the manuscript for the original&nbsp;<i>Curious George</i>, the book was published in America in 1941. More than 200 Curious George titles followed, with 75 million books sold&nbsp;worldwide. Curious George has been successfully adapted into a major motion picture and an Emmy-winning television show on&nbsp;PBS.&nbsp;www.curiousgeorge.com.</p>George wants a five-dollar train car at the toy store, and on the advice of the Man in the Yellow Hat, he saves up for it by helping a neighbor. He has the money by week&#x2019;s end but gets distracted en route to the shop, leaving his piggy bank at the playground. Luckily for George, a girl turns in his piggy bank, and in a good-deeds turn, he shares the money. Voil�! A cheaper train car and a friend.

Inky had been getting used to his new environment, but the staff quickly figured out that he had to be kept amused or he would get bored. Then one night in 2016 Inky, about the size of a basketball, decided he&#x2019;d had enough. He slithered eight feet across the floor and down a drainpipe more than 160 feet long to his home in the sea.<br> <br>Acclaimed author Sy Montogmery reminds readers that Inky didn&#x2019;t escape&#x2014;but instead, like the curious animal he is, wanted to explore the rest of the vast ocean he called his home.</p><p>Sy Montgomery is a naturalist, documentary scriptwriter, and author of twenty acclaimed books of nonfiction for adults and children, including the National Book Award finalist <i>The Soul of an Octopus </i>and the memoir&nbsp;<i>The Good Good Pig</i>, a&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestseller. The recipient of numerous honors, including lifetime achievement awards from the Humane Society and the New England Booksellers Association, she lives in New Hampshire with her husband, border collie, and flock of chickens.<br><br>Amy Schimler-Safford&nbsp;started her career in textile and surface design. She now illustrates children&#x2019;s books and lives on a lake in Georgia with her family and lots of country critters, all of whom provide Amy with a constant source of amusement and inspiration.Acclaimed nature writer Montgomery has written about octopuses for adults and middle-graders (The Octopus Scientists, 2015). Now she brings the curious cephalopod to the pre- and primary-school sets. Inky achieved worldwide fame after escaping from New Zealand&#x2019;s National Aquarium via a floor drain. Montgomery tells Inky&#x2019;s story by imagining his life as a young hatchling in the Pacific Ocean, noting the food he would eat, how he&#x2019;d use his suckers (to grip and taste!), and his driving desire to explore. Drama enters in the form of a moray eel, which injures Inky, who then hides in a lobster trap. Luckily, the fisherman who finds Inky takes him to the aquarium, and the rest is history. The mixed-media illustrations make good use of dynamic spreads, color, and texture&#x2014;perfect for a book on a master of camouflage. Montgomery seamlessly incorporates interesting facts about octopuses into the narrative, such as octopuses&#x2019; tendency to change color to match their mood. An author&#x2019;s note provides more information on Inky, observations about octopuses in captivity, and fun facts. &#x2014; Julia Smith Author: Booklist Online Source: June 22, 2018<br><br>Montgomery (2015&#x2019;s The Octopus Scientists and The Soul of an Octopus) has channeled her considerable octopus knowledge into a narrative nonfiction picture book based on an incident at a New Zealand aquarium. After a lobsterman took a young injured octopus to a nearby aquarium, it healed and grew, eventually finding its way back to the Pacific Ocean. Montgomery uses age-appropriate language to convey an impressive amount of information. The text is accessible and makes use of relatable comparisons to everyday items such as grains of rice and soccer balls. No background knowledge of octopuses is assumed, but two terms, beak and jet are used without explanation; readers may be able to infer their meanings from the text. Inky is assigned thoughts and feelings, although as the text explains, changes in the octopus&#x2019;s skin color can indicate emotions. Schimler-Safford&#x2019;s engaging mixed-media collages in realistic colors, some reminiscent of Eric Carle, fill the page and beautifully complement the narrative&#x2014;readers will want to closely inspect all the details. Back matter includes an endnote describing other octopus escapes, &#x201c;Eight Fun Octopus Facts&#x201d; (which are a simplified version of the &#x201c;Octet of Octo Facts&#x201d; in The Octopus Scientists), a short bibliography, and links to news stories about Inky&#x2019;s escape. VERDICT Montgomery&#x2019;s expertise and the gorgeous illustrations make this a fine purchase for libraries serving early elementary students.&#x2013;Judy Poyer, Anne Arundel County Public Library, MD Author: School Library Journal Source: July 2018<br><br>"In&nbsp;2016, an octopus named Inky made global news by escaping from New Zealand&#x2019;s National Aquarium. This story recounts that event and imagines Inky&#x2019;s pre- and postaquarium life in the wild. &#x201c;Each octopus set out on a journey alone. They&#x2019;re born ready to explore,&#x201d; Montgomery (<i>How to Be a Good Creature</i>) writes in her direct, deeply respectful prose. At birth, Inky is &#x201c;the size of a grain of rice,&#x201d; and his considerable intellect and ultrapliable body stand him in good stead as he grows until, baseball-size and bitten, he&#x2019;s scooped up in a fisherman&#x2019;s net and taken to an aquarium. Life in captivity means crab snacks, toys (he plays with Lego blocks and Mr. Potato Head), and tickles from his trainer. But his innate curiosity wins out, and one night, Inky slips out of his tank and slides into a floor drain that leads back to the ocean. Textured mixed-media collages by Schimler-Safford (<i>Hidden City</i>) playfully evoke underwater scenes with brilliant hues. Inky regards the world with eager, lightly anthropomorphized googly eyes, but he&#x2019;s never over-romanticized and emerges as a wily, winning personality. A final spread offers more octopus facts for eager learners." -- <i>Publishers Weekly</i> Author: Publishers Weekly Source: September 3, 2018<br><br>Inky, an octopus, began his life in the Pacific Ocean but was caught in a lobster trap and transferred to a New Zealand aquarium Life there is seemingly blissful, filled with playful activities, friendships with aquarium keepers, and admiring onlookers. Yet when presented with a loose tank cover, Inky takes the opportunity to squeeze himself through the ga, into a drainpipe on the floor, and then&nbsp; out into the Pacific, where he (presumably) lives today. Montgomery (who also wrote <i>The Octopus Scientists</i>, rev. 7/15, for older readers, for the Scientists in the Field series) weaves detailed science into Inky&#x2019;s life story, helpingreaders to understand octopus birth and growth, the dangers faced in daily life in the open ocean, and the curiosity and emotions expressed by octopuses. Schimler-Safford&#x2019;s brightly colored illustrations effectively capture the beautiful blues of Inky&#x2019;s aquatic environments, show his sinuous flexibility, and hint at his intelligence. A detailed endnote provides additional information on the real Inky as well as several other octopus &#x201c;escapes&#x201d;; &#x201c;8 Fun Octopus Facts&#x201d; outline some of the remarkable abilities of the species.

Effective notetaking is for college students who are serious about being successful in study, and teachers who want to know how best to help their students learn. Being a successful student is far more about being a smart user of effective strategies than about being &#39;smart&#39;. Research has shown it is possible to predict how well a student will do simply on the basis of their use of study strategies. This workbook looks at the most important group of study skills - how to take notes (with advice on how to read a textbook and how to prepare for a lecture). You&#39;ll be shown how to: - format your notes - use headings and highlighting - write different types of text summaries and pictorial ones, including concept maps and mind maps (you&#39;ll find out the difference, and the pros and cons of each) - ask the right questions - make the right connections - review your notes - evaluate text to work out which strategy is appropriate. There&#39;s advice on individual differences and learning styles, and on how to choose the strategies that are right for both you and the situation. Using effective notetaking strategies will help you remember what you read. It will help you understand more, and set you on the road to becoming an expert (or at least getting good grades!). Successful studying isn&#39;t about hours put in, it&#39;s about spending your time wisely. You want to study smarter not harder. As always with the Mempowered books, this thorough (and fully referenced) workbook doesn&#39;t re-hash the same tired advice that&#39;s been peddled for so long. Rather, Effective notetaking builds on the latest cognitive and educational research to help you study for success. This 3rd edition has advance organizers and multi-choice review questions for each chapter, plus some additional material on multimedia learning, and taking notes in lectures.</p><p></p><h2>Texas Ranger (A Texas Ranger Thriller, 1)</h2><p><b>Instant #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestseller</b><b><br></b><b>In James Patterson's white-hot Western thriller, a Texas Ranger fights for his life, his freedom, and the town he loves as he investigates his ex-wife's murder.</b> <b></b><b> <br><br> </b>Across the ranchlands and cities of his home state, Rory Yates's discipline and law-enforcement skills have carried him far: from local highway patrolman to the honorable rank of Texas Ranger.

Quietly luminous watercolors capture details of dress, dwelling, implements, flora, and fauna against an open landscape of rolling hills. Small touches dramatize the story's moods: a bouquet of brown-eyed Susans flung to the ground in anger; an empty nest in a pine tree as the woman disappears behind the western hills; the glimmer of a single firefly as man and wife are reconciled.

This extensively revised manual provides a proven therapeutic framework for evaluating suicidal risk and developing and implementing a suicide-specific treatment plan that is respectful, empathic, and empowering. In addition to their clinical utility, the procedures used for assessment, treatment, and progress monitoring within CAMS can help reduce the risk of malpractice liability. In a large-size format for easy photocopying, the book includes all needed reproducible tools for implementing CAMS. Purchasers also get access to a Web page where they can download and print the reproducible materials. For CAMS training opportunities with David A.

He maintains a private clinical and forensic practice in Washington, DC."CAMS dramatically decreases suicidal ideation and overall symptom distress while increasing hope, patient satisfaction, and retention to clinical care....We suicidologists believe suicidal people must be meaningfully understood, appreciated, and given particular skills to find their way in life. This book is a major contribution in this singular pursuit."--from the Foreword by Marsha M. Linehan, PhD, ABPP, Professor and Director Emeritus, Behavioral Research and Therapy Clinics, University of Washington; developer of DBT<br><br> "There are few books that I recommend hands-down as 'must reads' for all behavioral health clinicians--this is one of them. In this second edition, Jobes has succeeded in summarizing a prolific 30-year clinical research career in suicidology into a can&#x2019;t-put-it-down, novel-like professional resource. The evidence-based CAMS approach in this book has saved lives and will continue to save the lives of patients at high risk for suicide."--Alan L. Peterson, PhD, ABPP, Department of Psychiatry, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio<br><br> "This book provides powerful, evidence-based tools for engaging patients and managing the situations that tend to unnerve clinicians the most. CAMS offers a way for clinician and patient to work as a team using the self-identified drivers of distress in the patient&#x2019;s language. The approach is refreshingly patient-centered and collaborative--the way most clinicians wish they could work. It allows the clinician to be courageous, honest, and to relinquish the illusion of control, while having a potentially life-saving impact. Crossing any lines of theoretical orientation, CAMS can be readily implemented 'in the trenches.' I hope this fantastic book becomes a cornerstone in every clinical training program in the mental health disciplines."--Christine Moutier, MD, Chief Medical Officer, American Foundation for Suicide Prevention<br><br> "CAMS is a prominent feature of the clinical landscape of therapeutics for suicidality. The second edition of this manual is an eagerly awaited update that reflects significant research advances, making it an essential addition to the modern clinician's toolbox. CAMS is effective, and, crucially, it is well liked by both patients and clinicians. This book offers an articulate and practical account of a leading therapy."--Thomas Joiner, PhD, The Robert O. Lawton Distinguished Professor of Psychology, Florida State University<br><br> "Jobes is one of the leading forces in suicide prevention, whose ideas and thinking have led to untold advances. The influence of CAMS can be seen within all of today's most established approaches to reducing suicidal behavior. Flipping through the well-worn pages of my copy of the first edition of <i>Managing Suicidal Risk</i>, I didn't think it would be possible to improve upon it. But true to form, Jobes has knocked it out of the park. This second edition synthesizes our rapidly expanding knowledge of safe and effective care for suicidal patients. It is an essential tool for any clinician."--Craig J. Bryan, PsyD, ABPP, Department of Psychology and National Center for Veterans Studies, University of Utah<br><br> &#x201c;It is not uncommon for people who are considering suicide to interact with medical and/or mental health clinicians in the months leading up to an attempt. The CAMS framework provides a flexible and thorough structure for new and seasoned social workers to thoroughly assess and intervene with suicidal clients. By incorporating <i>Managing Suicidal Risk, Second Edition,</i> into our direct practice curriculum, it is my hope that all of our graduates will feel prepared to assess and treat suicidality.&#x201d;--Jonathan Kratz, MSW, LCSW, Clinical Assistant Professor, Anne and Henry Zarrow School of Social Work, University of Oklahoma<br><br>"<i>Managing Suicidal Risk: A Collaborative Approach, Second Edition,</i> provides a thorough introduction to the use of the Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicide (CAMS) protocol.

Jobes offers an evidence-based treatment framework which was seemingly co-authored with his many patient-survivors of suicide over years of research and treatment. The manual provides important updates to the first edition which have resulted from rigorous evaluation of the CAMS model.

The success of the CAMS framework and what sets it apart from other treatment approaches is the emphasis placed on understanding the broader, underlying issues at the core of the suicidal patient. Jobes provides an alternative approach instead of the traditional focus on suicidal ideation as a symptom of a broader psychopathology. Moreover, it is clear that Jobes speaks from a scientist-practitioner perspective as evidenced by his extensive knowledge and activity in suicide research as well as by his personal case examples.

She was born into royalty in 1755 and married the future king of France at age 15. By 21 she ascended to the throne and enjoyed a lavish lifestyle of masquerade balls, sky-high wigs, and extravagant food. But her taste for excess ruffled many feathers. The poor people of France blamed Marie Antoinette for their poverty. Her spending helped incite the French Revolution. And after much public outcry, in 1793 she quite literally lost her head because of it. Whether she was blameless or guilty is debatable, but Marie Antoinette remains woven into the fabric of history and popular culture.</p><p>Dana Meachen Rau has written more than 300 books for children, including picture books, early readers, nonfiction, and biographies.<p></p><p>Who Was Marie Antoinette?</p><p>On April 21, 1770, fifteen-year-old Marie Antoinette left home and traveled to France. She had always lived a royal life. Her parents were the emperor and empress of Austria. The young archduchess was leaving behind her beloved homeland. She was engaged to marry Louis Auguste, the future king of France.</p><p>Marie Antoinette rode in a jeweled coach amid a parade of more than fifty other carriages. Hairdressers, chefs, and other attendants traveled with her for the two-and-a-half-week journey. Peasants cheered along the road between Vienna, Austria, and Strasbourg, France.

Because Thor was a real person, who appeared in a public on a few occasions (including at the United Nations headquarters in New York City), the legend of the Stranger at the Pentagon has grown, becoming a real head-scratcher for 21st-century UFO researchers. Today, it is still one of the hottest topics in ufology, having spawned various other books, documentaries, and even feature Hollywood films. <br><br> What exactly happened to Valiant Thor? Did he get back on his spaceship and return to his home planet, or did he help the U.S. government set up alien-human hybrid experimentation in remote underground bases? Or was he imprisoned - thrown in the clink - by those in the government who have been fighting UFO Disclosure all these years? <br><br> Since no one knows how long an alien can live, could Valiant Thor still be alive today, in 2016, somewhere in - or under - our nation's capitol? <br><br> This special reprint - the 6th revised edition from 2001 - features an introduction by Dr. Harley Byrd, nephew of Adm.

While men are able to compartmentalize things like casual sex, women typically view any form of cheating as an affront to their entire relationship. They think: "If he is lying to me about sex, he's probably lying to me about everything." For betrayed women, trust just flat-out disintegrates. Without proper guidance, men--who are often unaware of the type and degree of pain they have caused their spouse--have little chance of restoring it.<br><br>Underneath the hurt and betrayal, usually there is still love. Where there is love and motivation for change, there is hope for the relationship to move forward. Robert Weiss, a nationally acclaimed expert in the treatment of sex, infidelity, and intimacy issues, has spent over 25 years helping couples find peace and healing. In "Out of the Doghouse" he shares his expertise, illuminating the concrete steps men can take to rebuild trust, restore intimacy, and save their primary relationship.

When Yoren had dragged her&nbsp;&nbsp;into that alley she'd thought he meant to kill her, but the sour old man had<br><br>only held her tight, sawing through her mats and tangles with his dagger. She&nbsp;&nbsp;remembered how the breeze sent the fistfuls of dirty brown hair skittering&nbsp;&nbsp;across the paving stones, toward the sept where her father had died. "I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;taking men and boys from the city," Yoren growled as the sharp steel scraped<br><br>at her head. "Now you hold still, boy." By the time he had&nbsp;&nbsp;finished, her scalp was nothing but tufts and stubble.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Afterward he told her that from there to Winterfell she'd be Arry the&nbsp;&nbsp;orphan boy. "Gate shouldn't be hard, but the road's another matter. You got a&nbsp;&nbsp;long way to go in bad company. I got thirty this time, men and boys all bound&nbsp;&nbsp;for the Wall, and don't be thinking they're like that bastard brother o'&nbsp;&nbsp;yours." He shook her. "Lord Eddard gave me pick o' the dungeons, and I didn't&nbsp;&nbsp;find no little lordlings down there. This lot, half o' them would turn you over&nbsp;&nbsp;to the queen quick as spit for a pardon and maybe a few silvers. The other&nbsp;&nbsp;half'd do the same, only they'd rape you first. So you keep to yourself and&nbsp;&nbsp;make your water in the woods,alone. That'll be the hardest part, the pissing, so don't drink no more'n you&nbsp;&nbsp;need."<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leaving King's Landing was easy, just like he'd said. The Lannister guardsmen on the gate were stopping everyone, but Yoren called one by name and their wagons were waved through. No one spared Arya a glance. They were looking for a highborn girl, daughter of the King's Hand, not for a skinny boy with his hair chopped off. Arya never looked back. She wished the Rush would rise and wash the whole city away, Flea Bottom and the Red Keep and the Great Sept and&nbsp;&nbsp;everything, and everyone too, especially Prince Joffrey and&nbsp;&nbsp;his mother. But she knew it wouldn't, and anyhow Sansa was still in the city<br><br>and would wash away too. When she remembered that, Arya decided to wish for&nbsp;&nbsp;Winterfell instead.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoren was wrong about the pissing, though. That wasn't the hardest part at all; Lommy Greenhands and Hot Pie were the hardest part. Orphan boys. Yoren had&nbsp;&nbsp;plucked some from the streets with promises of food for their bellies and shoes&nbsp;&nbsp;for their feet. The rest he'd found in chains. "The Watch needs good men," he&nbsp;&nbsp;told them as they set out, "but you lot will have to do."<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yoren had taken grown men from the dungeons as well, thieves and poachers and rapers and the like. The worst were the three he'd found in the black cells who must have scared even him, because he kept them fettered hand and foot in the back of a wagon, and vowed they'd stay in irons all the way to the Wall. One&nbsp;&nbsp;had no nose, only the hole in his face where it had been cut off, and the gross&nbsp;&nbsp;fat bald one with the pointed teeth and theweeping sores on his cheeks had eyes like nothing human.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They took five wagons out of King's Landing, laden with supplies for the Wall: hides and bolts of cloth, bars of pig iron, a cage of ravens, books and paper and ink, a bale of sourleaf, jars of oil, and chests of medicine and spices. Teams of plow horses pulled the wagons, and Yoren had bought two coursers and a half-dozen donkeys for the boys. Arya would have preferred a real horse, but the donkey was better than riding on a wagon.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The men paid her no mind, but she was not so lucky with the boys. She was two years younger than the youngest orphan, not to mention smaller and skinnier,&nbsp;&nbsp;and Lommy and Hot Pie took her silence to mean she was scared, or stupid, or<br><br>deaf. "Look at that sword Lumpyhead's got there," Lommy said one morning as&nbsp;&nbsp;they made their plodding way past orchards and wheat fields. He'd been a dyer's&nbsp;&nbsp;apprentice before he was caught stealing, and his arms were mottled green to<br><br>the elbow. When he laughed he brayed like the donkeys they were riding.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where's a gutter rat like Lumpyhead get him a sword?"<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arya chewed her lip sullenly. She could see the back of Yoren's faded black&nbsp;&nbsp;cloak up ahead of the wagons, but she was determined not to go crying to him<br><br>for help.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe he's a little squire," Hot Pie put in. His mother had been a baker&nbsp;&nbsp;before she died, and he'd pushed her cart through the streets all day, shouting&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hot pies! Hot pies!" "Some lordy lord's little squire boy, that's&nbsp;&nbsp;it."<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He ain't no squire, look at him. I bet that's not even areal sword. I bet it's just some play sword made of tin."<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arya hated them making fun of Needle. "It's castle-forged steel, you stupid," she snapped, turning in the saddle to glare at them, "and you better shut your mouth."<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The orphan boys hooted. "Where'd you get a blade like that, Lumpyface?" Hot&nbsp;&nbsp;Pie wanted to know.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lumpyhead," corrected Lommy. "He prob'ly stole it."<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I did not!" she shouted. Jon Snow had given her Needle. Maybe she&nbsp;&nbsp;had to let them call her Lumpyhead, but she wasn't going to let them call Jon a&nbsp;&nbsp;thief.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If he stole it, we could take it off him," said Hot Pie. "It's not his<br><br>anyhow. I could use me a sword like that."<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lommy egged him on. "Go on, take it off him, I dare you."<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hot Pie kicked his donkey, riding closer. "Hey, Lumpyface, you gimme that&nbsp;&nbsp;sword." His hair was the color of straw, his fat face all sunburnt and&nbsp;&nbsp;peeling. "You don't know how to use it."<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes I do, Arya could have said. I killed a boy, a fat boy like&nbsp;&nbsp;you, I stabbed him in the belly and he died, and I'll kill you too if you don't&nbsp;&nbsp;let me alone. Only she did not dare. Yoren didn't know about the&nbsp;&nbsp;stableboy, but she was afraid of what he might do if he found out. Arya was&nbsp;&nbsp;pretty sure that some of the other men were killers too, the three in the&nbsp;&nbsp;manacles for sure, but the queen wasn't looking for them, so it&nbsp;&nbsp;wasn't the same.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look at him," brayed Lommy Greenhands. "I bet he's going to cry now. You&nbsp;&nbsp;want to cry, Lumpyhead?"<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had cried in her sleep the night before, dreaming of herfather. Come morning, she'd woken red-eyed and dry, and could not have shed&nbsp;&nbsp;another tear if her life had hung on it.</p><h2>Undone: Will Trent</h2><p>In the trauma center of Atlanta&#x2019;s busiest hospital, Sara Linton treats the city&#x2019;s poor, wounded, and unlucky&#x2014;and finds refuge from the tragedy that rocked her life in rural Grant County.

There was a lot to be said for a man who, after&nbsp;forty years, still managed to hold your attention.<br><br>&nbsp;Judith rolled down the car window, letting in some of the cool,&nbsp;spring air. Downtown Atlanta was only thirty minutes away, but out&nbsp;here in Conyers, you could still find areas of undeveloped land, even&nbsp;some small farms. It was a quiet place, and Atlanta was just far&nbsp;enough away so that she could appreciate the peace. Still, Judith&nbsp;sighed as she caught a quick glimpse of the city&#x2019;s skyscrapers on the&nbsp;distant horizon, thinking, <i>home</i>.&nbsp;<br><br>She was surprised at the thought, that Atlanta was now a place she&nbsp;considered her home. Her life until recently had been suburban, even&nbsp;rural. She preferred the open spaces to the concrete sidewalks of the&nbsp;city, even while she admitted that it was nice living in so central a&nbsp;location that you could walk to the corner store or a little caf� if&nbsp;the mood struck you.&nbsp;<br><br>Days would pass without her even having to get into a car&#x2013;&nbsp;the type of life she would have never dreamed of ten years ago. She&nbsp;could tell Henry felt the same. His shoulders bunched up around his&nbsp;ears with tight resolve as he navigated the Buick down a narrow&nbsp;country road. After decades of driving just about every highway and&nbsp;interstate in the country, he instinctively knew all the back routes,&nbsp;the doglegs and shortcuts.&nbsp;<br><br>Judith trusted him to get them home safely. She sat back in her&nbsp;seat, staring out the window, blurring her eyes so that the trees bordering&nbsp;the road seemed more like a thick forest. She made the trip to&nbsp;Conyers at least once a week, and every time she felt like she saw&nbsp;something new&#x2013;a small house she&#x2019;d never noticed, a bridge she&#x2019;d&nbsp;bumped over many times but never paid attention to. Life was like&nbsp;that. You didn&#x2019;t realize what was passing you by until you slowed&nbsp;down a little bit to get a better look.&nbsp;<br><br>They&#x2019;d just come from an anniversary party in their honor,&nbsp;thrown together by their son. Well, more likely thrown together by&nbsp;Tom&#x2019;s wife, who managed his life like an executive assistant, housekeeper,&nbsp;babysitter, cook and&#x2013;presumably&#x2013;concubine all rolled up&nbsp;into one. Tom had been a joyful surprise, his birth an event doctors&nbsp;had said would never come about. Judith had loved every part of him&nbsp;on first sight, accepted him as a gift that she would cherish with every&nbsp;bone in her body. She had done everything for him, and now that&nbsp;Tom was in his thirties, he still seemed to need an awful lot of taking&nbsp;care of. Perhaps Judith had been too conventional a wife, too subservient&nbsp;a mother, so that her son had grown into the sort of man&nbsp;who needed&#x2013;expected&#x2013;a wife to do everything for him.&nbsp;Judith certainly had not enslaved herself to Henry. They had&nbsp;married in 1969, a time when women could actually have interests&nbsp;other than cooking the perfect pot roast and discovering the best&nbsp;method to get stains out of the carpet. From the start, Judith had&nbsp;been determined to make her life as interesting as possible. She&#x2019;d been&nbsp;a room mother at Tom&#x2019;s school. She&#x2019;d volunteered at the local homeless&nbsp;shelter and helped start a recycling group in the neighborhood.&nbsp;When Tom was older, Judith took a job doing light bookkeeping for&nbsp;a local business and joined a running team through the church to&nbsp;train for marathons. This active lifestyle stood in stark contrast to&nbsp;that of Judith&#x2019;s own mother, a woman who toward the end of her life&nbsp;was so ravaged from raising nine children, so drained from the constant&nbsp;physical demands of being a farmer&#x2019;s wife, that some days she&nbsp;was too depressed to even speak.&nbsp;<br><br>Though, Judith had to admit, she had herself been a somewhat&nbsp;typical woman in those early years. Embarrassingly, she was one of&nbsp;those girls who had gone to college specifically to find a husband. She&nbsp;had grown up near Scranton, Pennsylvania, in a town so small it&nbsp;didn&#x2019;t merit a dot on the map. The only men available to her were&nbsp;farmers, and they were hardly interested in Judith. Judith could not&nbsp;blame them. The mirror told no lies. She was a bit too plump, a bit&nbsp;too bucktoothed, and a bit too much of everything else, to be the&nbsp;sort of woman Scranton men took for a wife. And then there was her&nbsp;father, a stern disciplinarian whom no sane man would seek out for a&nbsp;father-in-law, at least not in exchange for a bucktoothed, pearshaped&nbsp;girl who had no natural talent for farming.&nbsp;<br><br>The truth was that Judith had always been the odd one in the family,&nbsp;the one who didn&#x2019;t quite fit in. She read too much. She hated&nbsp;farmwork. Even as a young girl, she was not drawn to animals and&nbsp;did not want to be responsible for their care and feeding. None of her&nbsp;sisters and brothers had been sent away for higher education. There&nbsp;were two brothers who had dropped out of ninth grade, and an older&nbsp;sister who had married rather quickly and given birth to her first&nbsp;child seven months later. Not that anyone bothered to do the math.&nbsp;Enveloped in a constant state of denial, her mother had remarked to&nbsp;her dying day that her first grandchild had always been big-boned,&nbsp;even as an infant. Thankfully, Judith&#x2019;s father had seen the writing on&nbsp;the wall so far as his middle girl was concerned. There would be no&nbsp;marriage of convenience with any of the local boys, not least of all&nbsp;because none of them found her remotely convenient. Bible college,&nbsp;he decided, was not just Judith&#x2019;s last&#x2013;but her only&#x2013;chance.&nbsp;At the age of six, Judith had been struck in the eye by a flying&nbsp;piece of debris as she chased after the tractor. From that moment on,&nbsp;she&#x2019;d always worn glasses. People assumed she was cerebral because of&nbsp;the glasses, when in fact the opposite was true. Yes, she loved to read,&nbsp;but her tastes ran more toward trashy dime novel than literary. Still, the&nbsp;egghead label had stuck. What was it they used to say? &#x201c;Men don&#x2019;t&nbsp;make passes at women who wear glasses.&#x201d; So, it was surprising&#x2013;no,&nbsp;more like shocking&#x2013;when on Judith&#x2019;s first day of college in her first&nbsp;class, the teaching assistant had winked at her.<br><br>She had thought something was in his eye, but there was no mistaking&nbsp;Henry Coldfield&#x2019;s intentions when, after class, he had pulled&nbsp;her aside and asked her if she&#x2019;d like to go down to the drugstore and&nbsp;have a soda with him. The wink, apparently, was the beginning and&nbsp;end of his gregariousness. Henry was a very shy man in person;&nbsp;strange, considering he later became the top salesman for a liquor distribution&nbsp;company&#x2013;a job he passionately despised even three years&nbsp;past retirement.&nbsp;<br><br>Judith supposed Henry&#x2019;s ability to blend had come from being the&nbsp;son of an Army colonel, moving around the country so often, never&nbsp;staying at one base more than a few years at a time. There was no passionate&nbsp;love at first sight&#x2013;that came later. Initially, Judith had simply&nbsp;been attracted to the fact that Henry was attracted to her. It was a&nbsp;novelty for the pear from Scranton, but Judith had always been at the&nbsp;opposite spectrum of Marx&#x2019;s philosophy&#x2013;Groucho, not Karl: She&nbsp;was more than willing to join any club that would have her as a member.&nbsp;Henry was a club unto himself. He was neither handsome nor&nbsp;ugly; forward nor reticent. With his neatly parted hair and flat accent,&nbsp;<i>average </i>would be the best way to describe him, which Judith&nbsp;later did in a letter to her older sister. Rosa&#x2019;s response had been something&nbsp;along the lines of, &#x201c;Well, I suppose that&#x2019;s the best you can hope&nbsp;for.&#x201d; In her defense, Rosa was pregnant at the time with her third&nbsp;child while her second was still in diapers, but still, Judith had never&nbsp;forgiven her sister for the slight&#x2013;not against herself, but against&nbsp;Henry. If Rosa failed to notice how special Henry was, it was because&nbsp;Judith was a poor writer; Henry too nuanced a man for mere&nbsp;words on a page. Perhaps it was all for the best. Rosa&#x2019;s sour observation&nbsp;had given Judith a reason to break from her family and embrace&nbsp;this winkingly introverted, mercurial stranger.&nbsp;<br><br>Henry&#x2019;s gregarious shyness was only the first of many dichotomies&nbsp;Judith had observed in her husband over the years. He was&nbsp;terrified of heights, but had earned his amateur pilot&#x2019;s license as a&nbsp;teenager. He sold alcohol but never imbibed. He was a homebody,&nbsp;but he spent most of his adult life traveling through the Northwest,&nbsp;then the Midwest, as promotions moved them around the country&nbsp;much like the Army had done when Henry was a child. His life, it&nbsp;seemed, was all about making himself do things he did not want to&nbsp;do. And yet, he often told Judith that her company was the one thing&nbsp;that he truly enjoyed.&nbsp;<br><br>Forty years, and so many surprises.&nbsp;<br><br>Sadly, Judith doubted her son held any such surprises for his&nbsp;spouse. While Tom was growing up, Henry was on the road three&nbsp;weeks out of every four, and his parenting came in spurts that didn&#x2019;t&nbsp;necessarily highlight his more compassionate side. Subsequently,&nbsp;Tom became everything his father had shown him during those&nbsp;growing years: strict, unbending, driven.&nbsp;<br><br>There was something else to it as well. Judith didn&#x2019;t know if it was&nbsp;because Henry saw his sales job as a duty to his family rather than his&nbsp;passion, or because he hated being away from home so much, but it&nbsp;seemed that every interaction he had with their son held an underlying&nbsp;tension: <i>Don&#x2019;t make the same mistakes I&#x2019;ve made. Don&#x2019;t get trapped in a&nbsp;job you despise. Don&#x2019;t compromise your beliefs to put food on the table. </i>The&nbsp;only positive thing he recommended to the boy was marrying a good&nbsp;woman. If only he had been more specific. If only he hadn&#x2019;t been so&nbsp;hard.&nbsp;<br><br>Why was it that men were such exacting parents to their male&nbsp;children? Judith guessed they wanted their sons to succeed in places&nbsp;they had not. In those early days, when Judith was first pregnant, the&nbsp;thought of a daughter had spread a rapid warmth through her body,&nbsp;followed by a searing cold. A young girl like Judith, out there in the&nbsp;world, defying her mother, defying the world. It gave her an understanding&nbsp;of Henry&#x2019;s desire that Tom do better, be better, have everything&nbsp;that he wanted and more.&nbsp;<br><br>Tom had certainly succeeded at his job, though his mouse of a&nbsp;wife was a disappointment. Every time Judith came face-to-face with&nbsp;her daughter-in-law, she itched to tell the woman to stand up&nbsp;straight, speak up and, for the love of God, grow a backbone. One of&nbsp;the volunteers at the church had said the other week that men married&nbsp;their mothers. Judith hadn&#x2019;t argued with the woman, but she&#x2019;d defy anyone to find a lick of similarity she shared with her son&#x2019;s wife.&nbsp;<br><br>Except for the desire to spend time with her grandchildren, Judith&nbsp;could never see her daughter-in-law again and be perfectly happy.&nbsp;The grandchildren were the sole reason they had moved to&nbsp;Atlanta, after all. She and Henry had uprooted their retirement life in&nbsp;Arizona and moved almost two thousand miles to this hot city with&nbsp;its smog alerts and gang killings just so they could be close to two of&nbsp;the most spoiled and ungrateful little things this side of the&nbsp;Appalachia.&nbsp;<br><br>Judith glanced at Henry as he tapped his fingers on the steering&nbsp;wheel, humming tunelessly as he drove. They never talked about&nbsp;their grandchildren except in glowing terms, possibly because a fit of&nbsp;honesty might reveal that they didn&#x2019;t much like them&#x2013;and then&nbsp;where would they be? Their lives turned upside down for two small&nbsp;children who were on gluten-free diets, strictly regimented naptimes&nbsp;and tightly scheduled playdates, but only with &#x201c;like-minded&nbsp;children who shared the same goals.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>So far as Judith could see, the only goal her grandchildren had was&nbsp;to be the center of attention. She imagined you couldn&#x2019;t sneeze without&nbsp;finding a like-minded, self-centered child, but according to her&nbsp;daughter-in-law, it was an almost impossible task. Wasn&#x2019;t that the&nbsp;whole point of youth, to be self-centered? And wasn&#x2019;t it the job of&nbsp;the parent to drill that out of you? Certainly, it was clear to all involved&nbsp;that it wasn&#x2019;t the job of the grandparents.&nbsp;<br><br>When little Mark had spilled his unpasteurized juice on Henry&#x2019;s&nbsp;slacks and Lilly had eaten so many of the Hershey&#x2019;s Kisses she&#x2019;d&nbsp;found in Judith&#x2019;s purse that she&#x2019;d reminded Judith of a homeless&nbsp;woman at the shelter last month who was tweaking so badly on&nbsp;methamphetamines that she&#x2019;d wet herself, Henry and Judith had&nbsp;merely smiled&#x2013;chuckled, even&#x2013;as if these were merely wonderful&nbsp;little quirks that the children would soon grow out of.&nbsp;<br><br>Soon was not coming soon enough, however, and now that&nbsp;they&#x2019;d reached the ages of seven and nine, Judith was starting to lose&nbsp;faith that one day, her grandchildren would turn into polite and loving&nbsp;young adults who did not feel the urge to constantly interrupt&nbsp;adult conversation and run around the house screaming at such high decibels that animals two counties over started howling. Judith&#x2019;s only&nbsp;consolation was that Tom took them to church every Sunday. She of&nbsp;course wanted her grandchildren exposed to a life in Christ, but&nbsp;more importantly, she wanted them to learn the lessons taught in&nbsp;Sunday School. <i>Honor thy mother and father. Do unto others as you would&nbsp;have them do unto you.

After years of training and adventure, Son Goku has become Earth's ultimate warrior, and his son, Gohan, shows even greater promise. But the strikes are increasing as even deadlier enemies threaten the planet. And that means non-stop action as Goku, Gohan, time travelers, aliens, deities and the mighty Super Saiyans clash over the fate of the universe! <br><br><b>The Many Faces of Freeza</b> After a razor-close call, Son Goku and company triumphed in rescuing the Dragon Balls from Freeza's evil claws. Now they must go head to head with one seriously ticked-off alien overlord! What's worse, Freeza's got a trick up his sleeve. He has the power to transform--not once, not twice, but three times--and with each new hideous face comes a massive power increase! With Goku recovering from his fight with Captain Ginyu, the gang must band together and hold Freeza off as long as they can. But even with all their power combined, the odds are in Freeza's favor. As the battle rages on, defeating Freeza seems more and more impossible. The only hope lies in the one thing Freeza fears--the legend of the Super Saiyan!</p><p>Renowned worldwide for his playful, innovative storytelling and humorous, distinctive art style, Akira Toriyama burst onto the manga scene in 1980 with the wildly popular Dr. Slump.

But she hid a secret life. She was a prescription drug addict. She was also a &#x201c;doctor shopper&#x201d; who manipulated Upper East Side psychiatrists for pills, pills, and more pills; a lonely bulimic who spent hundreds of dollars a week on binge foods; a promiscuous party girl who danced barefoot on banquets; a weepy and hallucination-prone insomniac who would take anything&#x2014;<i>anything</i>&#x2014;to sleep.<br> <br>This is a tale of self-loathing, self-sabotage, and yes, self-tanner. It begins at a posh New England prep school&#x2014;and with a prescription for the Attention Deficit Disorder medication Ritalin. It continues to New York, where we follow Marnell&#x2019;s amphetamine-fueled rise from intern to editor through the beauty departments of <i>NYLON</i>, <i>Teen Vogue</i>, <i>Glamour</i>, and <i>Lucky</i>.

To me, being a beauty editor was better than being president of the United States! Yes, I lifted these lines directly from the opening of the movie Goodfellas and replaced &#x201c;gangster&#x201d; with &#x201c;beauty editor.&#x201d; But they work here, in my story, too.<br> <br>In front of me are two very rare back issues of Beauty Queen Magazine, the hottest title of the nineties. Full of brassy Magic Marker blondes with ballpoint pen&#x2013;red lips and crudely drawn noses that look like dicks, the mag featured &#x201c;the most beautiful ladies age 10&#x2013;20&#x201d; in the latest fashions: wedding dresses, bikinis, and what appears to be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. snorkeling gear. As for beauty, the &#x201c;Feb&#x2013;June 1991&#x201d; issue&#x2019;s cover girl, Lindsay Liner, is &#x201c;[a]dvertising New Michanne Make-Up&#x201d;&#x2014;and we know this because there&#x2019;s an arrow drawn from the credit, pointing directly at Ms. Liner&#x2019;s face. Alternately, the &#x201c;July&#x2013;Sept 1991&#x201d; cover model is sans fard: &#x201c;Sally Smothers, an all-natrural [sic] girl without make-up!&#x201d; the cover line reads. &#x201c;Does she look right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But Cat, who published this dope magazine?&#x201d; all you print aficionados must be wondering. &#x201c;Hearst? Hachette? Meredith Corp.?&#x201d; No, no, and (definitely) no. I published Beauty Queen Magazine. I launched it in 1990, at seven years old. Young Caitlin Marnell was also editor in chief, art director .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. everything! If you were a blood relative, you subscribed to my magazine whether you fucking liked it or no: that was my readership. Which explains why there are still so many back issues floating around a quarter of a century later.<br> <br>I hadn&#x2019;t seen a copy of Beauty Queen Magazine for fifteen years when I discovered the two issues in 2010 in one of my grandmother Mimi&#x2019;s keepsake drawers. I was gobsmacked as I paged through them. Had I really been tuned in to like things like advertiser relationships and beauty credits and &#x201c;makeunder&#x201d; stories and cover lines when I was in third grade? The evidence was right there in my hands. I&#x2019;d been &#x201c;playing&#x201d; beauty editor almost twenty years before I actually became one.<br> <br>Crazy, right?! But then again, I guess that&#x2019;s just how it is when you&#x2019;re hardwired to do something&#x2014;to be something. And I&#x2019;m sure of it: I was born hardwired to be a beauty editor. The thing is, I was also born hardwired for addiction&#x2014;I believe so, anyway&#x2014;and this has caused some .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. problems.<br> <br>But I&#x2019;m getting way ahead of myself. Let&#x2019;s turn back time, shall we?<br> <br>Warning! If you are grossed out by &#x201c;white girl privilege&#x201d; (who isn&#x2019;t?), you might want to bail now. I am from the same town as disgraced former E! network personality Giuliana Rancic&#x2014;Bethesda, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, DC, so white that you could practically snort it like a line&#x2014;and there&#x2019;s nothing I can do about that. Believe me, I have tried to cut this chapter out twice! My editor keeps making me put it back in. Also, I get very bored talking about my childhood, which means you might get very bored reading about it. Let&#x2019;s just get it over with.<br> <br>I was born on September 10, 1982, in the District of Columbia under a crack-rock white moon (Marion &#x201c;bitch set me up&#x201d; Barry was mayor, after all). I&#x2019;ve got a cassette tape recording of my birth and everything. A sample:<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a girl!&#x201d; the doctor announces.<br> <br>&#x201c;A girl?&#x201d; my mother wails. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t want a girl!&#x201d; Aw.<br> <br>When I was a kid, I had it all and then some. I grew up in a swanky neighborhood that was about &#x201c;twenty minutes from the White House,&#x201d; as my parents always said. The houses on my street, Kachina Lane, were so far apart that no one ever had any trick-or-treaters on Halloween. Our next-door neighbor was a Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning journalist who&#x2019;d uncovered a CIA plot to assassinate Fidel Castro. He was Mormon and had about a zillion blond grandchildren and a huge, kooky storybook-�looking Tudor house with a &#x201c;bee problem&#x201d; in the walls. This meant there was a crack over the living room sofa that oozed honey, and you could swipe the trickle and then pop your finger into your mouth. Mmm.<br> <br>On the other side of our property was the white-clapboard Hermon Presbyterian Church. I played hide-and-seek in the pretty little cemetery with my chocolate lab, Benny the Bear. Then there were some woods, and then&#x2014;two minutes down the road&#x2014;there was a cream-�colored mansion at 8313 Permission Tree Road. When I was about thirteen, someone put up iron gates with a cursive T on them. Then the boxer Mike Tyson moved in! He&#x2019;d just gotten out of jail for rape. My sister and brother&#x2014;Emily and Phil&#x2014;and I would wave at his white limo. Sometimes we saw him grocery shopping at the Giant Foods in Potomac Village.<br> <br>What did the Pulitzer Prize winner, Mike Tyson, and the Marnell family have in common? Our properties had backyards adjacent to the famous Congressional Country Club golf course.<br> <br>&#x201c;FORE!&#x201d; we&#x2019;d scream, right as a senator/golfer type was trying to focus on a crucial putt. Our backyard trampoline was practically on top of one of the holes.<br> <br>When tournaments like the US Open came through, my sister and I sold soda cans and water bottles through the fence for a dollar a pop. We broke into the course in the summer to run around in the sprinklers; I was also always uprooting the strange mini&#x2013;Capitol Building domes that were all over the place and smuggling them back to my yard. In the winter, we&#x2019;d go sledding in Congressional, which wasn&#x2019;t that great. You know how golf courses are! They aren&#x2019;t made for children or real fun. You&#x2019;d slide down a not-so-steep man-made incline and then&#x2014;whoop&#x2014;drop another foot into a sand trap. So that was as good as the sledding got.<br> <br>Our front yard was sprawling and green-green-green, just like the golf course. Strangers used to picnic out there; my parents let them. We had a tennis court, and a Waldorf School&#x2013;looking playground that was carved out of trees that had fallen during thunderstorms. We used the dogwood trees as soccer goals, and there were long swings hanging down from the branches of our tulip poplars. Bean pods and little pieces of fairylike fluff were always flittering down from the mimosa trees; we had a bunch of magnolia trees, too, and they had dark leaves and ultrafragrant white flowers. I used to climb them and spy on all the birds&#x2019; nests. The azalea bushes bloomed sunset colors every spring: pink, orange, orangey-red, and lavender. And there were camellia bushes, too.<br> <br>Seriously, it was insane. One time a woman even knocked on our front door and said that she was sorry if she seemed crazy, but ever since she was a little girl she&#x2019;d dreamt of getting married at 7800 Kachina Lane&#x2014;and now she was engaged! She showed us her diamond ring and everything. My parents wound up letting her have the wedding in the backyard, by the swimming pool and the rose garden. We all got to go! I hit the dance floor in a honeysuckle crown.<br> <br>My brother, sister, and I were beyond lucky to live in this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Shangri-la for ten years. My father&#x2014;not so much. Five acres is a lot to keep up with. And my dad insisted on doing the lawns himself, like he was a farmer instead of a psychiatrist. There was this cranky old red tractor that came with the property, and when we were small we always had to get on there with him&#x2014;I guess to share in his misery. I mean, I can&#x2019;t remember volunteering to get on this tractor. It just jostled you violently in the seat. It was always spitting fire balls at my dad and breaking down. He cursed at it a lot. My grandmother wanted to buy us a llama to eat the lawn, but my dad said no. He thought Mimi was a birdbrain.<br> <br>Then there was the house itself! God, it was so cool and good-�looking&#x2014;supercontemporary. Like&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you know how Brad Pitt sort of thinks he&#x2019;s an architect? Brad Pitt would have loved this house. Mimi and my parents bought it from a movie producer in 1987, a few months before my fifth birthday. The story was that the legendary Frank Lloyd Wright designed it originally, but he wound up clashing with the producer&#x2019;s wife and abandoned the project to one of his students, who finished it. God knows if any of that&#x2019;s true. Either way, the place was sick. It was the skinniest house you&#x2019;ve ever seen. From the front, it looked like a military bunker&#x2014;long and one-story, with kooky rows of tiny square windows. From above, it looked like a .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a pinwheel, okay? Like, there was a wand&#x2014;that was the bedrooms and the den and the hall&#x2014;and the roof was flat and covered in gravel. You could climb a Japanese maple tree to get up there, and then walk around and bang on the skylights and scare your nanny. And the head of the pinwheel was made up of the kitchen, the dining room, and the living room, which were wrapped around a huge stone chimney in the middle. You could run through all three spaces on a loop.<br> <br>The front doors were oversize and three inches thick&#x2014;dark oak, engraved. The wind always blasted them open, and my dad would lose it over the heat or AC that leaked out. The place cost a fortune in utilities every month. This was also because there were hardly any real walls. Everything was glass! When I was five, a massive tree fell through the glass living room during a summer storm. It was very Robert Frost: &#x201c;Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away / You&#x2019;d think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.&#x201d; Do you know that poem? &#x201c;Birches.&#x201d; My dad quoted it all the time. Another day a little girl was over, running in and out of the house, playing tag with her brother and Phil. Then, SMASH! She ran right through one of the glass walls, and it shattered all over her. The blood gushed out of her in sheets! I saw the whole thing. It looked like the movie Carrie; she screamed and screamed. An ambulance came to take her to the hospital.<br> <br>Oh, it was such a special house. Surely I have not done it justice with my descriptions. I wish you could look it up on StreetEasy or somewhere, but you can&#x2019;t. When I was fifteen, my parents sold the house to a synagogue. I think they kept the stone chimney, but that&#x2019;s it. The magnificent front yard is now a very ugly parking lot. I mean, no offense to Adat Shalom or anything&#x2014;but it is exceptionally unsightly. Then again, I guess anything would look awful compared to the beautiful memories in my mind.<br> <br>I will now give you what you bought this book for: juicy gossip about my fascinating parents! I&#x2019;ll get right to it.<br> <br>My mom had a scale and it said: THINNER&#x2014;like the Stephen King movie. Everything about my mother was skinny&#x2014;even her nickname for me: &#x201c;Bones.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do these come in seven narrow?&#x201d; she&#x2019;d ask at the weird Italian shoe store at the Tysons II mall.<br> <br>My dad gave my mom Shalimar perfume for Christmas, but she refused to wear it. She returned the furs and jewelry he bought her, too. All she wanted was furniture, furniture, furniture. It was all bizarre and ultramodern&#x2014;to match the insane house. Her side tables looked like bicycle pumps and her living room chairs seemed like they were imported from Guant�namo Bay. Her &#x201c;pieces&#x201d; were always shattering or poking you with a sharp corner if you bumped into them. There were no throw pillows or curtains or dust ruffles or anything feminine. Everything was angular. The only thing in the whole house with any curves was the baby grand piano.<br> <br>My parents&#x2019; master suite had a glass wall overlooking the cherry blossom grove and the forsythia bushes in the backyard, and a white-and-gold tub with Jacuzzi jets that never worked. That&#x2019;s where the nannies would comb out my lice while I cried in my bathing suit. My mom smoked exactly two cigarettes every morning back there, but she said she didn&#x2019;t. She kept the gold soft packs of Benson &amp; Hedges in her underwear drawer alongside her flesh-toned bras and bikini panties. They matched her peachy-nude manicures that elongated her fingers, her neutral lipstick, her beige bob, and her tanned, toned arms.<br> <br>My mother had diabetes, so we always had a live-in nanny.<br> <br>&#x201c;My blood sugar is low,&#x201d; my mom would say when my sister and I had one of our knock-down fights. Then she&#x2019;d go back down the very long, skinny hall to her bedroom and shut the door.<br> <br>When I was in nursery school, the nannies were named things like Anka, Margaret, and Anna. Then the Berlin Wall came down, and I guess all the Eastern European girls went home. After that, our nannies were from Iowa: Ruth, Debbie, Karen, and Amy. They got us ready for school while my mom sat with her coffee and her insulin, watching Katie Couric and her gleamy crisscrossed legs on the Today show. My mom never flinched when she pricked her finger. Her diabetes drawer was full of syringes. One time I injected water into my belly. The needle didn&#x2019;t hurt at all.<br> <br>Mimi raised my mom in Virginia Beach. My mom&#x2019;s father loved golf so much that the Princess Anne Country Club flew their flag at half-mast when he died. My mom went to Norfolk Academy, then she boarded at St. Catherine&#x2019;s in Richmond. In college, she became anorexic. She kept a package of raw hot dogs chilled on her dorm room windowsill, and she ate one per day. She&#x2019;d stopped coming out of her room, but it took the college a while to realize it. Then my mom was in the hospital for a long time. I got all this dirt from Mimi. My mother didn&#x2019;t talk about it.<br> <br>And now she was a psychotherapist with a private practice on Forty-�Second Street NW and a part-time job at the Psychiatric Institute of Washington (PIW) on Wisconsin Avenue. She wasn&#x2019;t home much. Sometimes she took me to Saks Fifth Avenue in Chevy Chase to see a handbag she was &#x201c;thinking about.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hi, Stacey,&#x201d; the saleslady always said.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is my friend Jennifer,&#x201d; my mom would tell me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hi, sweetie,&#x201d; Saleslady Jennifer would coo. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard so much about you.&#x201d;<br> <br>My mom shopped and shopped and shopped. She would stay at the malls until they closed. Sometimes kids got to go. One night we came home at eight thirty&#x2014;a half hour past family dinner time. We&#x2019;d picked up takeout from California Pizza Kitchen. My brother and I carried the bags of food from the car into the dark dining room. Phil hit the switch for the chandelier, and that&#x2019;s when we saw it: all six chairs were in pieces all over the floor. The mahogany table was splintered. It looked like a tornado had come in! My mother had just bought them, too.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mom!&#x201d; I yowled.<br> <br>She came up behind me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Kids,&#x201d; she said. Her expression was as smooth as a stone in our Japanese rock garden. &#x201c;Go to your rooms.&#x201d;<br> <br>On my way downstairs, I saw that the potted tree in the foyer had been knocked over. A picture was off the wall. Someone&#x2014;I knew who&#x2014;had smashed absolutely everything. No one ever explained why.<br> <br>My dad was the chief of psychiatry at a big hospital and oversaw the adolescent unit at another. He made Washingtonian magazine&#x2019;s &#x201c;Best Doctors&#x201d; issue every year, but he told me it wasn&#x2019;t a real award.<br> <br>&#x201c;If you are homicidal or suicidal, please hang up and call 9-1-1,&#x201d; my dad&#x2019;s secretary chirped on his voice mail. &#x201c;Otherwise, leave a message.&#x201d;<br> <br>My dad&#x2019;s patients were always throwing urine on him, and things like that. Scratching him up or biting him, and he&#x2019;d have to take AIDS tests. Hanging themselves. It was a lot to deal with. He left the house at 6:45 a.m. sharp and came home hungry at 7:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. After dinner, he&#x2019;d be in his office for another hour. On Saturdays, he did a half day of rounds at the hospital. Sunday was his day off. But that&#x2019;s when he&#x2019;d get on the tractor.<br> <br>My dad loved...</p><h2>Who Was Ernest Shackleton?</h2><p>As a boy he preferred reading sea stories to doing homework and, at age 16, became an apprentice seaman.

She even locked him out of the house, tied him up with electrical cord, and on one occasion, gave him a beating that sent him to the emergency room. His fifteen-year-old half brother Matthew Montejo also was a victim to Jane Bautista's dark mood swings and erratic behavior, but for some reason, Jason received the brunt of the abuse&#x2015;until he decided he'd had enough...</p><p><b>A SON'S REVENGE</b><br>On the night of January 14, 2003, Jason strangled his mother. To keep authorities from identifying her body, he chopped off her head and hands, an idea he claimed he got from watching an episode of the hit TV series "The Sopranos." Matthew would later testify in court that he sat in another room in the house with the TV volume turned up while Jason murdered their mother. He also testified that he drove around with Jason to find a place to dump Jane's torso.</p><p><b>A CRIME THAT WOULD BOND TWO BROTHERS</b><br>The morning following the murder, Matthew went to school, and Jason returned to his classes at Cal State San Bernardino. When authorities zeroed in on them, Jason lied and said that Jane had run off with a boyfriend she'd met on the Internet. But when police confronted the boys with overwhelming evidence, Jason confessed all. Now the nightmare was only just beginning for him...</p></p><p><p><b>Tina Dirmann</b> is a reporter for <i>US Weekly</i> Magazine and has worked also for <i>The Los Angeles Times</i>.</p><p>1<br>Peter Martinez was bored, as usual. But after serving twenty-five years in the Marine Corps, including two tours of duty in Vietnam, the retired sergeant major enjoyed the quiet he found as a security guard charged with keeping an eye on the eighty or so multimillion-dollar homes that lined the sandy shore in the private community of Saint Malo Beach in Oceanside, California. He particularly enjoyed working the uneventful graveyard post and had grown accustomed to the simple sounds of the ocean as it roared in the not-too-far distance from his guard shack.<br>Despite its beauty, Oceanside was a place most visitors zooming down the 5 Freeway simply passed on their way to the more popular destination point of San Diego, just twenty minutes away and home not only to beaches, but to the very popular Sea World tourist attraction. In fact, the Oceanside beaches weren&#x2019;t even visible from the freeway, so tourists, and the troublemaking their revelry can sometimes bring, were scant.<br>Martinez was armed. As a career military man, he&#x2019;d had a pistol strapped to his side since he was 18 years old. But in the eight years he&#x2019;d worked as a Saint Malo Beach security guard, he&#x2019;d never pulled that firearm from his hip.<br>Still, he stiffened when he saw car headlights break the black night sky just before 2 a.m. on January 14, 2003.<br>The 2000 Oldsmobile Intrigue stopped several houses away from his shack, but he could still make out two figures as they lifted a bag out of their trunk. He watched as the pair struggled to heave their heavy load over their heads and into the roughly seven-foot-tall Dumpster in front of the neatly kept white two-story home at 2041 South Pacific Street. &#x201c;Someone&#x2019;s trying to dump a load of garbage,&#x201d; Martinez thought. But this was private property, so he walked toward the car to give them a friendly but stern reminder.<br>On approach, Martinez saw a tall man, easily over 6 feet, and a smaller man, maybe even a teenager, still gripping their oversized parcel.<br>&#x201c;What do you have there?&#x201d; Martinez asked.<br>Who knows why Jason Bautista froze in that moment? Maybe it was because he was only 20 years old and still used to listening to adults. Maybe because he was scared out of his mind and wasn&#x2019;t sure what to do.<br>But he dropped the bag onto the ground and froze. Matthew Montejo, his 15-year-old half-brother, mimicked his every move. Both men looked up at Martinez, who saw what looked like fear on the face of the smaller guy, the one he considered the sidekick.<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re just dumping some trash,&#x201d; Jason said.<br>&#x201c;Well, you can&#x2019;t dump trash here,&#x201d; Martinez said. &#x201c;You have to pick it back up and leave.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; Jason said, before turning to Matthew. &#x201c;Pick it up, let&#x2019;s get it back in the car.&#x201d;<br>As he spoke, the old security guard looked down at the bag. He would later tell investigators it looked like a body bag, the kind he&#x2019;d seen too many times during his years of service in the Marines. In actuality, it was a dark brown sleeping bag and he couldn&#x2019;t see what was inside. But there was something in there. The bag drooped in the middle as the boys heaved on the ends.<br>Matthew obeyed his older brother&#x2019;s instructions, lifting the bag again. Martinez watched as the folds of the sleeping bag shifted, pulling back just far enough to reveal a human foot.<br>Martinez felt shock rip through him. His mind reeled as he stared at the dangling foot. He hoped for a moment that he was looking at a doll or part of a mannequin. But the tightness in his gut told him otherwise.<br>&#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; he called out. &#x201c;Stop! Put the bag down! I want to see what&#x2019;s in there.&#x201d;<br>Jason didn&#x2019;t listen.<br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he told the old man as he stuffed the bag back in the trunk and slammed it shut, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to let you.&#x201d;<br>On instinct, Martinez reached for the .357 pistol at his side and pointed it at the men. &#x201c;I said freeze!&#x201d; Martinez repeated.<br>&#x201c;Fuck you!&#x201d; Jason spat back. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re just a security guard! You can&#x2019;t do anything.&#x201d; He slammed the trunk shut before climbing back into the driver&#x2019;s seat.<br>Martinez stood still, his grip on the gun. But he never fired. There had already been enough violence this night. Instead, as the car sped away, he took note of the license plate number. Returning to his guard shack, Martinez, shaken by what he&#x2019;d just seen, called the Oceanside Police Department. And suddenly, the calming sounds of the ocean were drowned out by a police dispatcher&#x2019;s voice.<br>It was about 8:30 a.m. on the morning of January 14 when Orange County Sheriff&#x2019;s Homicide Investigator Andre Spencer peered down the steep ravine off the Ortega Highway. Earlier that morning, a passenger in a car driving east on the 5 Freeway had spotted what looked like human remains lying in the fields near Mile Marker 79. Spencer was the next one up for an assignment, so it had fallen to him to lead the investigation. After thirteen years as a sworn officer, he was used to dealing with death. But as his eyes strained through a pair of binoculars, scanning the extreme hilly fields down the freeway, he was still startled at the sight, some 170 feet below him, of the headless, handless torso of a white female, clad only in her panties. The remains were ghostly pale because someone had taken the trouble to drain the corpse of most of its blood.<br>Spencer knew how tough this one would be. &#x201c;If she had a head or hands,&#x201d; he thought, &#x201c;we&#x2019;d run fingerprints, dental records.&#x201d; They&#x2019;d have to swab the body instead and hope for a DNA match. His mind churned for ideas, determined to find out who this woman was and how she&#x2019;d met such a gruesome end.<br>It would be seven days before that license plate number scribbled down by security guard Peter Martinez would hit Spencer&#x2019;s desk&#x2014;the tip leading investigators to discover that the torso at the bottom of the ravine was 41-year-old Jane Bautista. Bautista, through the course of her life, had become obsessed by the idea that nameless, faceless strangers were out to kill her, but, in the end, her killers would be the only people she ever allowed to be close to her&#x2014;her sons Jason and Matthew.</p></p><h2>Asterix Omnibus #1: Collects Asterix the Gaul, Asterix and the Golden Sickle, and Asterix and the Goths (1)</h2><p>Asterix is celebrating 60 sensational years as an international comics superstar, and in the first collected edition from Papercutz, the stories are newly translated into American English for a new generation of fans!

It doesn't seem to be a snowball, or an egg, or anything to eat, but it does seem to be very cold. Penguin knits it a scarf and thus begins a beautiful friendship. The cartoon illustrations are done with thick rounded lines, bright colors, and plenty of white space to give this story warmth and personality. Pinecone, overall a fairly quiet friend, visibly shivers, says "brrrr," and even starts sneezing. When Penguin's grandpa advocates taking him to the faraway forest where he can thrive, Penguin puts his own loneliness aside for his friend's well being. Though they can't live in the same place, the two remain close always. The spare text and clean illustrations, done in a nice variety of spot art and single and double pages, work well for sharing with a group while the tale provides great opportunities for talking one-on-one. A lovely story of a caring and unselfish friendship.-Julie Roach, Cambridge Public Library, MA &#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011. Library Journals LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Media Source, Inc.

In Phillips's household, greens were made with pork, and it wasn&#x2019;t Sunday without fried chicken. So she had to transform the way she cooks.

It is intended for children approaching or experiencing puberty, typically represented by the 10-14 years old age range. The artwork has been specially produced for the book and includes accurate biological drawings as well as cartoon illustrations to keep the young reader interested. Most importantly of all, the Bible is the constant reference point, so that what the Bible has to say about the matters dealt with is always front and center. The result is that this book conveys essential biblical ethical teaching as well as the facts about puberty.<br><br>For example, here s an extract from the teaching on the chapter on Physical Intimacy :<br><br>So special that God has given us rules<br><br>It might seem attractive to live in a world where there are no laws. (Of course it would mean that your parents would never be able to tell you that you were doing something wrong!) But have you ever thought what would happen if there were no laws about how we should drive a car? The laws of the road make it safe for us to drive. If there were none, many more people on the road would get injured and driving would be a very frightening experience. God has given us a law regarding how we relate to the opposite sex in sexual intimacy. This law is the seventh of the Ten Commandments: You shall not commit adultery (Exodus 20:14). From this verse and other passages in the Bible, we learn that all sexual activity outside marriage is wrong. The word adultery means either being married and experiencing sexual intimacy with someone who is not your husband, or experiencing sexual intimacy with someone else s husband. In the New Testament, God warns us to flee from sexual immorality (1 Corinthians 6:18). The term sexual immorality includes any sexual activity that is not between a husband and his wife.<br><br>The fact that God has given us a specific command to keep sexual intimacy for marriage shows how important God considers sexual intimacy to be. The husband and wife are important to Him, their marriage is important to Him, and the new life that may result from sexual intimacy is important to Him. God s law about sexual intimacy is for our safety and well-being it protects us, it protects marriage, and it protects young life.</p><p>Dr. Chris Richards is a Consultant Pediatrician in Newcastle upon Tyne.

Will spring come early or late? But most importantly-- what does a groundhog have to do with the weather?</b> <br><br>Every year on February 2nd, people all across America watch groundhogs come out of their burrows-- especially in the town of Punxsutawney-- trying to figure out if the weather will stay cold, or begin to warm up. <br><br>In <i>Groundhog Day!</i>, children's nonfiction master Gail Gibbons delves into the history behind this unusual holiday, and examines the ancient traditions that evolved into our modern holiday. <br><br>With her signature combination of simple, clear text and bright illustrations, Gibbons introduces everything you need to know about groundhogs, too-- what they eat, where they live, and how they raise their young. <br><br>An overview of different Groundhog Day traditions around the country is included, as well as a page of groundhog trivia.&nbsp; A perfect introduction to this unique celebration!</p><p>According to <i>The Washington Post</i>, Gail Gibbons "has taught more preschoolers and early readers about the world than any other children's writer-illustrator." The multi award-winning Ms. Gibbons is the author of more than 100 books for young readers, including the bestselling titles <i>From Seed to Plant</i> and <i>Monarch Butterfly</i>. Her many honors include the Regina Medal, the Washington Post/Children's Book Guild Nonfiction Award and the NSTA Outstanding Science Trade Book Award.When you come right down to it, Groundhog Day isn't much of a holiday, so it's no surprise that this book needed a little more than just history and customs to make it viable. Gibbons presents the basics, but she also offers information on groundhogs to bolster the text. The book begins with several pictures of a groundhog peeking out of its burrow as text explains shadows and the old adage about six more weeks of winter. There's also a substantial piece about how, in times past, hibernating animals were watched for clues about the weather. Less successful is vaguely worded information; for example, this description of spring festivals: "about 1,500 years ago, people in Europe began lighting candles in the early spring for a new religious celebration." Gibbons' familiar artwork extends the text, especially in a two-page spread that offers an underground view of a groundhog's multichamber burrow. A brief look at how the holiday is celebrated and a page of additional facts conclude the book. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Keep out!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> But there&#x2019;s one big exception: lions. Lions are the only cats that live in social groups, called prides. Within a pride, nearly every female is related. Moms, sisters, aunts, and cousins all work together to raise cubs and hunt for enough food to support the pride. A dominant male or two will guard the pride&#x2019;s territory. He also babysits the cubs while their mothers are off hunting.<br> &nbsp;<br> Young males are forced to leave the pride once they are old enough to hunt for themselves. These lions sometimes form small, all-boy gangs, called bachelor groups.

Miscellaneous facts are also included in small-print sentences that curve under or over the illustrations. The tone of the first-person narration doesn't get in the way of the information presented, with the minor exception of a section describing chameleons as "grumpy." While this title does not attempt to be a comprehensive introduction, some basic material is missing. Specifically, the text does not mention the lizard's tail, which in most species is prehensile and aids in gripping branches. Additionally, most of the species depicted are not identified.

Her inspirational life story is sure to sweeten your soul.</p><p>Veronica Chambers lives in Los Angeles, California. Julie Maren lives in Boulder, Colorado.Gr. 2-4, younger for reading aloud. In this picture-book biography, Chambers offers a brief, lyrical tribute to salsa superstar Celia Cruz. Short paragraphs follow the vocalist from her Havana childhood, where neighbors crowded the street to hear young Celia sing to her family, to her heartbreaking emigration from Cuba and worldwide stardom. Chambers writes in figurative language that, while adding a whimsical, fairy-tale quality to the story, may confuse younger children ("Celia would grow up to be a queen, but she was not born a princess"), and specific musical references, such as "Afro-Cuban rhythms," will likely be lost on youngsters. That said, Chambers' enthusiasm for her subject is contagious, and the bright, uncluttered paintings of rounded, stylized figures in saturated, tropical hues echo the energy in the words. With few books about Cruz available for this age group, this is a welcome addition to the biography shelves. An author's note, a discography, and a glossary of Spanish words used in the text are appended.

When she visits her friends&#39; homes, she eats fried chicken and spaghetti. May plans someday to go to college and live in an apartment of her own. But when her family moves back to Japan, she soon feels lost and homesick for America. In Japan everyone calls her by her Japanese name, Masako. She has to wear kimonos and sit on the floor. Poor May is sure that she will never feel at home in this country. Eventually May is expected to marry and a matchmaker is hired. Outraged at the thought, May sets out to find her own way in the big city of Osaka. With elegant watercolors reminiscent of Grandfather&#39;s Journey, Allen Say has created a moving tribute to his parents and their path to discovering where home really is. The accompanying story of his mother and her journey as a young woman is heartfelt. Vividly portraying the graceful formality of Japan, Tea with Milk effectively captures th</p><p><p>Allen Say was born in Yokohama, Japan, in 1937. He dreamed of becoming a cartoonist from the age of six, and, at age twelve, apprenticed himself to his favorite cartoonist, Noro Shinpei. For the next four years, Say learned to draw and paint under the direction of Noro, who has remained Say's mentor. Say illustrated his first children's book -- published in 1972 -- in a photo studio between shooting assignments. For years, Say continued writing and illustrating children's books on a part-time basis. But in 1987, while illustrating THE BOY OF THE THREE-YEAR NAP (Caldecott Honor Medal), he recaptured the joy he had known as a boy working in his master's studio. It was then that Say decided to make a full commitment to doing what he loves best: writing and illustrating children's books. Since then, he has written and illustrated many books, including TREE OF CRANES and GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY, winner of the 1994 Caldecott Medal. He is a full-time writer and illustrator living in Portland, Oregon.</p>Say's masterfully executed watercolors tell as much of this story about a young woman's challenging transition from America to Japan as his eloquent, economical prose. Raised near San Francisco, Masako (her American friends called her May) is uprooted after high school when her parents return to their Japanese homeland. In addition to repeating high school to learn Japanese, she must learn the arts of a "proper Japanese lady"Aflower arranging, calligraphy and the tea ceremonyAand is expected to marry well. Declaring "I'd rather have a turtle than a husband," the independent-minded Masako heads for the city of Osaka and gets a job in a department store. With his characteristic subtlety, Say sets off his cultural metaphor from the very start, contrasting the green tea Masako has for breakfast in her home, with the "tea with milk and sugar" she drinks at her friends' houses in America. Later, when she meets a young Japanese businessman who also prefers tea with milk and sugar to green tea, readers will know that she's met her match. Say reveals on the final page that the couple are his parents. Whether the subject is food ("no more pancakes or omelets, fried chicken or spaghetti" in Japan) or the deeper issues of ostracism (her fellow students call Masako "gaijin"Aforeigner) and gender expectations, Say provides gentle insights into human nature as well as East-West cultural differences. His exquisite, spare portraits convey emotions that lie close to the surface and flow easily from page to reader: with views of Masako's slumping posture and mask-like face as she dons her first kimono, or alone in the schoolyard, it's easy to sense her dejection. Through choice words and scrupulously choreographed paintings, Say's story communicates both the heart's yearning for individuality and freedom and how love and friendship can bridge cultural chasms.

James Howe&#x2019;s lovable dinosaur is of a size outmatched only by her determination, and has talent outmatched only by her charm. Accompanied by Randy Cecil&#x2019;s beguiling illustrations, here is an irresistible story that proves that no problem is too big when the heart and imagination know no bounds.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, August 2010</strong>: From Syd Hoff&#x2019;s <em>Danny and the Dinosaur</em> (1958) to Jane Yolen&#x2019;s <em>How Do Dinosaurs Say Goodnight</em> (2000), very early readers have long befriended dinosaurs between the pages of a book. The interaction of these enormous creatures rendered as lovable, comic characters has proven to be irresistible among the pre-K to Grade 1 set.&nbsp; Therefore, it will come as no surprise when young readers fall hard for James Howe and Randy Cecil&#x2019;s very funny and endearing new picture book, <em>Brontorina</em>, which stars Brontorina Apatosaurus, an enthusiastic and surprisingly agile dino who is determined to become a ballerina. She arrives at the doorstep of Madame Lucille&#x2019;s Dance Academy for Girls and Boys, exclaiming &#x201c;I want to dance!&#x201d; Although Brontorina is certainly graceful, there are some concerns about her large size and her apparent inability to &#x201c;fit in&#x201d; among the smaller dancers, let alone in a pair of ballet slippers, the studio, or the arms of her male partner. With warmth and humor, Madame Lucille and her young students discover that if they step outside the (rosin) box, solutions may be found to some of the biggest problems imaginable. <em>--Lauren Nemroff</em><b>James Howe</b>&nbsp;is the acclaimed author of more than eighty books for young readers, including the E.

How full of hope is that?! The first sign that things were turning around for me was that my sense of smell came back after twenty years. Now where before there was despair I'm so thankful to have hope and the means to make it happen...now there are tears of joy! It's a great book...Don't miss it!

His Recipe is likely to be the best cure available over the next decade." &#x2014; prestonpdx, Amazon Verified Purchaser. Howard Shifke fully recovered from Parkinson&#x2019;s Disease. This memoir presents Howard&#x2019;s story of getting Parkinson&#x2019;s and provides a detailed account of how he won the fight against it. The memoir tells the story of what it was like for Howard to live day-to-day with Parkinson&#x2019;s, getting through the daily challenges and misgivings as well as how he looked toward the future with hope. Howard suffered with internal tremors; extremely poor balance; Bradykinesia (walking -- hunched forward, shuffled feet, arms did not swing); rigidity (arms, legs and upper back were tight and extremely painful); constipation; inability to stand up straight, to get out of a chair without using arms, to go up and down stairs without holding railing; difficulty getting a utensil to his mouth when trying to eat; falling asleep in middle of the day; frozen face; inability to write or to type with two hands; extreme fatigue. In the fall of 2009, Howard Shifke was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x2019;s Disease. His mother had Parkinson&#x2019;s for twenty-four years before dying in 2007, just two years prior to Howard diagnosis of Parkinson&#x2019;s. Having watched her physically deteriorate from the disease and mentally deteriorate from the medications was difficult and frightening. Howard did not want to end up the way his mother had ended up with the disease. Fortunately, in 1999, Howard had started studying alternative healing and Traditional Chinese Medicine. In the ten years leading up to his diagnosis, he had learned the body has the ability to heal itself. As a result, Howard decided he would endeavor to recover from Parkinson&#x2019;s, and he developed an alternative treatment methodology called his Parkinson&#x2019;s Recipe for Recovery�. Nine months later, he won the fight against Parkinson&#x2019;s with his full recovery. In Howard&#x2019;s two neurologist visits subsequent to his full recovery, his neurologist put him through all of the tests used for the original diagnosis. Both times, his neurologist documented in Howard&#x2019;s medical records that there were no signs or symptoms of Parkinson&#x2019;s Disease. Howard has been symptom free fully recovered from Parkinson&#x2019;s since June 12, 2010.</p><p>Howard Shifke was a native Floridian. In 2016, Howard, his wife Sally, and their dog, Cricket, moved to Warren, Oregon. Howard spends his days coaching people around the world, teaching them his Parkinson&#x2019;s Recipe for Recovery�. He also continues to write on his blog, which he started writing when he had Parkinson&#x2019;s Disease."An extraordinary story, "Fighting Parkinson's...and Winning" is an inspired and inspiring blend of personal memoir and an iconoclastic medical guide that is unreservedly recommended for the personal reading lists of anyone having to deal with Parkinson's in themselves or a loved one. While a critically important addition to community, medical school, college and university library Health/Medicine collections in general, and Parkinson's Disease supplemental studies reading lists in particular." -&nbsp;<i><b>Midwest Book Review</b></i><br><br>"As a Kinesiologist who has been running fitness programs for those living with Parkinson's, this book caught my attention. What was interesting about this book was that contrary to conventional thinking that you are a victim to Parkinson's, Howard took responsibility for his illness. He noted all the possible cumulative triggers and strategically developed a "recipe"to face them head on and heal his sick body, physically and emotionally. He&nbsp; provides the reader with every detail of his recipe along with a link to his&nbsp; website that gives a more visual perspective of the very specific exercises." - <i><b>Library of Clean Reads</b></i>&nbsp;<br><br>"Shifke himself had Parkinson's and details his life with the terrible disease. If you don't know anything about the disorder or what sufferers experience, the author gives a pretty good description as well as a general way the public can get an idea for themselves. He puts everything out there. But if you are suffering with Parkinson's, it is a good idea to read this book as Shifke takes readers through his journey to the other side. Shifke wants others to know how he suffered and made it through. He wrote this book to give hope to those with Parkinson's and it definitely does just that." -&nbsp;<i><b>Family Choice Awards</b></i><br><br>"This book is a must read for anybody with Parkinson's. It presents the disease from a perspective that you will not find anywhere else. Shifke explains in great detail how he developed his theory of Parkinson's as well as his methodology for his recovery. He takes the reader on his deeply personal journey of how he suffered, how he worked on his recovery daily, and how he made it through to the other side with a medically documented full recovery.&nbsp;The book was written to spread the message of hope for people with Parkinson's, and it delivers that message in no uncertain terms." -&nbsp;<i><b>Charlotte Area News</b></i></p><h2>Lucia the Luchadora</h2><p><b>Luc�a the Luchadora named one of the Best Books of 2017 by <i>NPR</i>, <i>Kirkus Reviews</i>, <i>Chicago Public Library</i> and more!&nbsp;</b>Luc�a zips through the playground in her cape just like the boys, but when they&nbsp;tell her "girls can't be superheroes," suddenly she doesn't feel so mighty.

Luc�a and her Abu&#x2014;short for abuela&#x2014;hatch a plan that will involve learning all about luchadores, the stars of a popular Mexican style of wrestling (lucha libre). By the end of the book, Luc�a has learned she must fight for what is right and has become a role model for other girls on the playground. Animated illustrations capture the equally vibrant main character, a brown-skinned girl with flowing long hair. The story, told in Luc�a's voice, has plenty of punch and humor and is chock-full of onomatopoeic sounds that just beg to be read aloud. The placement of the text moves along with the action, adding to the tone and breakneck pace of the story. The narrative encourages girls to trust their own strengths yet is never didactic. An author's note at the end explains luchadores and lucha libre.

His explanations of how to pray and meditate, heal oneself spiritually, find self confidence, and express love have helped millions change their lives for the better. <i>The Science of Mind</i> is one of those spiritual classics that belongs on the bookshelf of anyone who wishes a life for themselves free of compulsion and negativity. <i>--P. Randall Cohan</i>The Science of Mind, among the most respected spiritual books of our century, contains the fundamentals of Holmes&#39;s teachings and is a primary resource used by teaching centers and spiritual healers worldwide. The universal principles in this powerful book apply to people of all spiritual backgrounds as they describe the road to freedom attainable through the intelligent use of Nature&#39;s forces and laws to allow God - the creative power of love, freedom, and humanity - to work through them. Holmes seems to have anticipated the future in creativity and personal growth, and his book&#39;s goal is to suggest how you may pilot your entire life. Detailing the amazing, subtle powers of the mind, and how you can use them, it explains many of the basic truths known to the enlightened of all ages, and distills them to primary elements, easily understood.</p><h2>Patty Reed&#39;s Doll: The Story of the Donner Party</h2><p>In the winter of 1846, the Donner Party was stranded by heavy snows in the Sierra Nevada mountains.

The second volume in Bryan Lee O'Malley's epic, SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD, sees Mr. Pilgrim face off against another of Ramona's exes&#x2014;Hollywood icon and skateboard enthusiast Lucas Lee!</p><p>Starred Review. The first volume of this slacker-manga-action hybrid introduced Scott Pilgrim, a video game&#x2013;playing regular guy whose love life leads him into irregular trouble. This second book opens with a peek into Scott's past: we see his early romantic troubles and the talentless band that sprang from them. In the present, Scott's new romance with mysterious messenger girl Ramona Flowers sends his former girlfriend, teenage Knives Chau, into a fury that culminates in an all-out kung fu battle between the two. In the surrealist twists that fill O'Malley's work, characters who are introduced in dreams end up playing major parts in the "real" life of the story, and you never know when the meandering lives of these Canadian 20-somethings are going to shift into high-action fight sequences. O'Malley gained acclaim and award nominations for the first Scott Pilgrim book, and he deserves the recognition. The story continued here is delightful, light, clever and surprising. O'Malley takes a manga influence&#x2014;big eyes, informational inserts and explosions of energy&#x2014;and throws in pop culture references&#x2014;a band named the Clash at Demonhead, Ramona's skater turned movie star ex-boyfriend&#x2014;to create a fresh, grungy style. The narrative jumps, combined with sharp, sardonic dialogue, make this a great oddball tale that captures the energy of a generation. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.
